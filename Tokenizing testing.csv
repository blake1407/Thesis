307,41,510,Hamas does not have the capacity anymore for serious offensive action.

355,78,442,"As the Israeli assault on Gaza becomes even more transparently indefensible, I’d like to take on the three main “justifications” that I get the most."
356,78,442,1) They have to finish the job!
357,78,442,Hamas must be defeated!
358,78,442,"The obvious moral hypocrisy of believing that you are justified in killing babies to maybe kill some terrorists aside, this argument demonstrates a complete lack of understanding about what creates terrorism."
359,78,442,Pat Buchanan said that terrorism is the price of empire.
360,78,442,I think it’s the price of domination over other people.
361,78,442,"Honestly, how hard is it to put yourself in their shoes?"
362,78,442,"If someone killed your baby, would you be ready to go kill someone over it?"
363,78,442,What Israel has done to Gaza since October guarantees more Hamas or Hamas like groups.
364,78,442,2) What about the hostages?It is mind boggling that anyone can look at what Israel is doing and believe that their primary goal is to get the hostages out alive.
365,78,442,How many of them has Israel already killed?
366,78,442,"I don’t think anyone actually knows, but it should be self evident that destroying a city that you claim contains hostages is not motivated by valuing their safety above all."
367,78,442,Continuing the war doesn’t help the hostages.
368,78,442,"Israel can negotiate for them, as they have in the past."
369,78,442,They hold all of the chips and they’ve got plenty of hostages of their own.
370,78,442,3) If Israel doesn’t finish the job there will be more 10/7s.
371,78,442,This is laughably stupid.
372,78,442,"I don’t care what the loudest member of Hamas said they wanted to do, what matters is their ability to do it."
373,78,442,Hamas has never pulled off anything like 10/7 before and they’re not likely to ever be able to again.
374,78,442,"Israel underestimated/supported the threat, they can just not do that again."
375,78,442,Israel is a fortress and can easily secure its borders.
376,78,442,There is simply no justification for this war to continue and you should never support anyone who wants to force you to fund it.
377,94,186,"As recently as 2020, the Israeli government was begging Arab governments to continue funding Hamas."
378,94,186,Ask yourself why they'd do that.
379,94,186,Ask yourself why the most secure border on earth fell to people on paragliders.
380,94,186,"Consider who this war benefits: Netanyahu, whose corruption scandals are now ignored; Hamas leadership, some of whom are billionaires that don't even live in Gaza; The US/Western military industrial complex, who has a green light to fund a second proxy war; The US government, who has now silenced the anti-war right; And all at the low, low cost of the God knows how many innocent Israelis and Palestinians who will die."
381,94,186,"Please, think."
382,41,939,"As every single person knows, this ends when Hamas surrenders."
383,41,939,But Hamas wont surrender.

395,41,750,Agreed.
396,41,750,This is precisely why Palestinian civilians in Gaza should listen to Israels warnings and leave target areas -- and it is also precisely why Hamas is telling them not to do so.
