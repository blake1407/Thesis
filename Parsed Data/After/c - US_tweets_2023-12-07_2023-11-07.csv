mmpadellan,"November 18, 2023 10:41 PM","If January 6th was such a peaceful gathering and NOT an insurrection, why was domestic terrorist Ashli Babbitt shot while trying to climb through a window busted by ""peaceful tourists?""  Why were people trying to gouge the eyes out of police officers?  Why were both Republican and Democratic members of Congress forced to shelter in place while people tried to bash the doors in?  Why was there a gallows brought there while people chanted ""hang Mike Pence?""  Why did they evacuate Mike Pence?  Why was Josh Hawley running for his carpetbagging life?   Why was fecal matter smeared on the walls?  Why did Laura Ingraham and Don Jr frantically try to get Mark Meadows to get trump to stop the violence?  So many questions.",10622,3330,2476,667869
mmpadellan,"November 18, 2023 05:34 PM","Ive noticed that there is a huge disparity in which content is considered sensitive on this site in the past year, and its disturbing.  The replies to my tweets are filled with troll accounts that repeatedly post content that is supposed to be in violation of Twitter rules, replies using homophobic slurs, threatening violence -- and Twitter keeps saying ""we didnt find it in violation blah blah""  Meanwhile, I see dozens of replies to me that are completely innocuous, tweets that are flagged to contain ""sensitive content"" when its only a GIF saying ""Democracy Rules"" or someone high-fiving.  Its clear that Musk is busy promoting hateful, antisemitic content and hes punishing left wing content.  I hope Media Matters and other outlets get to the bottom of whats really going on.",3878,1148,1118,219379
mmpadellan,"November 09, 2023 01:35 AM","Bobblehead Ron DeSantis just told a bold-faced lie about President Biden. He tried to say that Bidens commitment to fighting Islamophobia somehow cancels out his dedication to fighting antisemitism.  That is a disgusting lie, and of course there are receipts because their desperate lies are pathetic.   There is ZERO fact-checking in #GOPDebate.   …",1269,316,117,81169

mmpadellan,"February 29, 2024 06:22 PM","I think its fucked up when you want to express your support for the Palestinian people, some people want to call you “Hamas sympathizers” or whatever.  Knock that shit off.  It IS possible to condemn the heinous acts of Hamas and believe that Palestinian civilians DO NOT deserve to be slaughtered, and DO need a two-state solution.  It IS possible to CONDEMN in the strongest terms the heinous attacks on civilians in Gaza City while they were trying to collect food from trucks.  I blame Netanyahu for it.  It is ALSO possible to support Israel’s right to exist, while being 100% anti-Netanyahu and believing that he is a major part of the problem.  If the slaughter of Palestinian women and children stops, he is out of a job.  We need a ceasefire NOW.",5238,1083,864,152691
mmpadellan,"February 28, 2024 03:48 AM","INTERESTING FACT:  Uncommitted got 11% of the vote in the DEM Michigan primary back in 2012 against President Obama.  He went on to win Michigan by almost half a million votes.  We are fortunate to have enough cushion for a significant slice of voters to voice their disagreement with foreign policy, but STILL get a convincing win in Michigan.   That said, the issue uncommitted voters are addressing is VERY serious and deserves attention: Netanyahu is a monster, and the slaughter of innocent civilians must stop and there absolutely needs to be a ceasefire now.  I believe President Biden knows this, and is doing things behind the scenes to broker a solution.  I respect that such a significant number of voters used their votes in this way to send a message to our President, and Im sure that he heard it, loud and clear.",1739,366,181,65484

mmpadellan,"June 21, 2024 11:26 PM","I dont know who needs to hear this, but picking the shittiest person you know for President just because he pisses the other side off is a really bad way to pick someone to be President.  He doesnt have the best words. Hes not good at business. Hes not compassionate. Hes not intelligent. Hes not honest. Hes not loyal. Hes not God.  Hes just a fucking asshole who broke the law without being held accountable SO MANY TIMES that being held accountable now feels wrong to him.  And nothing is RIGGED against his whiny bitch ass. In fact, he was born on third base swearing he hit a home run. Everything has been handed to him.  You could have picked ANYONE, but you insisted on picking the guy who tried to have millions of LEGAL votes throw out because hes a sore loser.  He tried to topple our democracy because hes a spoiled fucking brat who never learned that you cant win them all.  He stood by for 187 minutes doing NOTHING while Capitol Police had their eyes gouged out and got beaten with flagpoles and fire extinguishers.  This draft-dodging, pussy-grabbing, adjudicated rapist who is a twice-impeached fraud and convicted felon who mistakes Nikki Haley for Nancy Pelosi and thinks Joan Rivers voted for him 2 years AFTER she died.  THAT is who you choose.  Spite is a bad reason for choosing someone. THAT is why you will LOSE.",12111,3952,2522,492851
