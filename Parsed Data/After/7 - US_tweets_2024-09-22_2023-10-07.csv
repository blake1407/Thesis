PatTheSocialist,"November 02, 2023 09:50 PM",BREAKING: The House of Representatives just voted to give Israel $14.3 billion in more weapons to deepen US complicity in Israels genocidal attacks against Palestinians in Gaza. A shameful day in Congress.,1973,440,93,54019
TristanSnell,"July 28, 2024 12:57 AM",Donald Trump held a SUMMIT with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.  As a private citizen. At Mar-a-Lago.   The Logan Act is a federal law forbidding private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.  TRUMP IS BREAKING THE LAW — YET AGAIN,104229,31308,9418,3834124
TristanSnell,"August 21, 2024 03:07 AM",Donald Trump should be INDICTED — AGAIN.  PBS now reports Trump told Israeli Prime Minster Netanyahu to NOT agree to a cease fire because it would help Kamala Harris.  This is a violation of the Logan Act and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.,63389,18393,3049,956647
TristanSnell,"July 28, 2024 09:35 PM","Trump usually spends the summer in Bedminster, New Jersey.  Yet he met with Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago.  WHY?

brad_polumbo,"October 09, 2023 12:30 AM",I find the pro-Hamas protests happening in US cities unimaginably vile.   But to those calling on them to be shut down… nope. That’s not how free speech works.,1340,119,79,54722
RonFilipkowski,"July 25, 2024 04:56 PM",The Republican Party wants to give Benjamin Netanyahu a blank check to do whatever he wants in Gaza with no oversight or questions asked.

anthonyzenkus,"October 31, 2023 06:52 PM","Are u fucking kidding me?? At least 400 Palestinians killed by Israel in a targeted attack on a refugee camp.

benshapiro,"August 22, 2024 05:29 PM","Incredible that the Lefts response to Americans cheering to free American hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas (which denies a ceasefire), is that a Palestinian must speak in order to rip into the American ally Israel fighting to free those American hostages",1259,147,107,245695
benshapiro,"August 22, 2024 12:37 AM","Was supremely moved by this speech, which was searing and compassionate. Also seems essential to include a Palestinian speaker to the convention.   …",5622,1157,3780,1097497
benshapiro,"April 25, 2024 07:09 PM",These pro-Hamas protests are being fostered by the faculty and patted on the head by the administration. Thats because these colleges have been completely eaten by the evil intersectional ideology that crosses streams with Jew-hatred.,24177,3540,4531,3813012
benshapiro,"October 16, 2023 12:36 PM",We ought to have sympathy for both. And we ought to recognize that both are dead because of Hamas.,16712,3228,1560,1985328

benshapiro,"April 08, 2024 08:27 PM",The Biden administration is now effectively preparing to make aid to Israel contingent on. unspecified changes to Israeli policy. Which means that Israel can do little or nothing to appease the White House. Hamas is now in control of the Biden administration.,10326,2665,5459,2992359
