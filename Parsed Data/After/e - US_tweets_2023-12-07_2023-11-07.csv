I believe Palestine has a right to exist without the threat of violence.  I believe in a two-state solution.   I believe Hamas should be destroyed.   I believe it is HEINOUS to kill innocent children on either side no matter what you say your cause is.  I believe if youre bombing children in an attempt to destroy Hamas, then you are WRONG.",18362,4054,2979,1064880

Aside from Christians, there are: Catholic voters Jewish voters Muslim voters Buddhist voters Mormon voters Atheist voters  So stop shoving your Christianity down our throats.

mmpadellan,"January 06, 2024 08:38 PM","To all of the MAGA morons posting that January 6th is ""Entrapment Day"":  1. Nobody FORCED you to storm the US Capitol, smash windows, smear feces all over the walls, steal things, and chant ""Hang Mike Pence."" It wasnt Antifa or BLM doing that stuff. It was all YOU.  2. You cant get entrapped if youre not putting yourself in illegal situations  3. None of US were ""entrapped,"" we stayed our asses home  4. YOU FILMED YOURSELVES, MORONS  5. If you are bashing cops in the head with flagpoles and fire extinguishers, you get what you fucking deserve  6. Ashli Babbitt was NOT a hero, she was a domestic terrorist  7. Consider changing ""Entrapment Day"" to ""FAFO Day.""",35654,9222,6840,1789427
mmpadellan,"February 02, 2024 05:45 PM","People sometimes ask me why I choose the boring old guy with years of experience, whose decisions resulted in incredible job growth and a booming economy.   Instead of the twice-impeached rapist who has 91 felony counts, thinks he beat President Obama, and is actively rooting for America to suffer a financial crisis and a terrorist attack.  My answer: I choose President Biden over trump because Im not a fucking idiot.",8971,2117,2446,388625
mmpadellan,"February 28, 2024 03:48 AM","INTERESTING FACT:  Uncommitted got 11% of the vote in the DEM Michigan primary back in 2012 against President Obama.  He went on to win Michigan by almost half a million votes.  We are fortunate to have enough cushion for a significant slice of voters to voice their disagreement with foreign policy, but STILL get a convincing win in Michigan.   That said, the issue uncommitted voters are addressing is VERY serious and deserves attention: Netanyahu is a monster, and the slaughter of innocent civilians must stop and there absolutely needs to be a ceasefire now.  I believe President Biden knows this, and is doing things behind the scenes to broker a solution.  I respect that such a significant number of voters used their votes in this way to send a message to our President, and Im sure that he heard it, loud and clear.",1730,365,181,65484
mmpadellan,"March 03, 2024 02:58 AM","As one of the loudest advocates for President Biden on this platform, I think its totally fair to be critical of his position on Gaza.  But if youre doing that, shouldnt someone ask the other guy whos running for the job how hed handle it differently?   Dont let him get away with “oh, it wouldnt happen if I was in office.”  What would his POLICY be? He should be subject to the same level of scrutiny if hes running for the job, and does not deserve a free pass on it.   Because the policy with Israel isnt President Bidens.   Its a long-standing AMERICAN policy. ALL U.S. Presidents have supported Israel. But maybe its time to change that.   Maybe no more blank check “weve always been pals, so Ill send you money no matter what.”  Maybe we draw the line at their blatant, unchecked killing of women and children non-combatants and letting them starve to death.  Because while its been American policy to support them, its also been American policy not to support war crimes, mass murders, and starving civilians.   So, before punishing the guy whos in office now, doing what he can behind the scenes with shitty cards dealt him to rescue hostages, stop the bombing, and deliver humanitarian aid, lets compare apples to apples, because Im sure the other guy would be MUCH, MUCH worse.  He doesnt give a shit about Muslims unless theyre buying his property or giving his son-in-law billions of dollars.  And, as a Muslim, I WILL be voting for President Biden because I DO know the difference between someone who genuinely wants to help us, and someone who means Muslims and people of color harm.",11951,3275,3057,829534
mmpadellan,"March 24, 2024 12:36 AM","I see a lot of folks wanting to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene, and I get it, because shes extra horrible, the worst that maga has to offer.  Shes loud, ignorant, hateful, and hypocritical, and doesnt value anything except attention.  She votes against infrastructure projects and tries to take credit for them. She votes against border security and blames Democrats for lack of border security.  She wants to unseat Mike Johnson as House Speaker because he dared to work with Democrats to keep the government open.  Shes a raving lunatic who believes in Jewish space lasers and makes the shitty Republican party look even shittier.  Which is exactly why she should not be expelled.  yet. Keep her in as the extremist face of the GOP.  Make sure EVERYONE knows that if you vote for Republicans, you vote for the chaotic, selfish, and unseriousness of MAGA Marjorie Taylor Greene.",19241,5908,5111,911987
mmpadellan,"May 02, 2024 07:17 PM","Stop calling criticism of Israel antisemitic. Stop calling support of Jewish people ""Zionist."" Stop calling people opposed to the death of Palestinian civilians ""Hamas supporters.""  You can criticize Israel without being antisemitic, and you can support Palestinians without being a Hamas supporter.  You can BE HUMAN and care about others without having a politically radioactive label affixed to you.  Bring back the hostages AND ceasefire NOW.",7999,2300,1711,230154
mmpadellan,"May 21, 2024 11:36 PM","""When someone shows you who they are, you should believe them the first time."" -- Maya Angelou  Now, Im not saying that trump is a Nazi, but I find it peculiar that his words and actions make him look a lot like one.  For example, he:  - promised to be a dictator on Day One - kept a book of Hitlers speeches by his bed - referred to Charlottesville Nazis as ""very fine people"" - regularly pulls words and phrases from Hitler, like ""poisoning the blood of our country""  - previously shared antisemitic posts during previous campaigns - had dinner with well-known White Supremacist Nick Fuentes - said he would round up MILLIONS of human beings - told the Proud Boys to ""stand back and stand by"" - shared a video on his feed that features the words ""unified Reich.""  So no, Im not saying trump is a Nazi. But he sure is comfortable looking like one.",6079,2524,3622,168031
mmpadellan,"June 21, 2024 11:26 PM","I dont know who needs to hear this, but picking the shittiest person you know for President just because he pisses the other side off is a really bad way to pick someone to be President.  He doesnt have the best words. Hes not good at business. Hes not compassionate. Hes not intelligent. Hes not honest. Hes not loyal. Hes not God.  Hes just a fucking asshole who broke the law without being held accountable SO MANY TIMES that being held accountable now feels wrong to him.  And nothing is RIGGED against his whiny bitch ass. In fact, he was born on third base swearing he hit a home run. Everything has been handed to him.  You could have picked ANYONE, but you insisted on picking the guy who tried to have millions of LEGAL votes throw out because hes a sore loser.  He tried to topple our democracy because hes a spoiled fucking brat who never learned that you cant win them all.  He stood by for 187 minutes doing NOTHING while Capitol Police had their eyes gouged out and got beaten with flagpoles and fire extinguishers.  This draft-dodging, pussy-grabbing, adjudicated rapist who is a twice-impeached fraud and convicted felon who mistakes Nikki Haley for Nancy Pelosi and thinks Joan Rivers voted for him 2 years AFTER she died.  THAT is who you choose.  Spite is a bad reason for choosing someone. THAT is why you will LOSE.",12085,3954,2522,492860
