In fact, fentanyl is coming across the border in such large amounts the FBI director said theyve seized enough to kill 270 MILLION people.  Meanwhile, Biden regime has turned aggressively against Israel, it does not want Israel to win the war, and is leaking incessantly against Israel to their favorite media outlets, including the radical leftwing Politico.  It says it is concerned Israel is killing terrorists in populated areas (where Hamas terrorists operate, for crying out loud.) Check this out from the stenographers for Biden at Politico:  U.S. officials have asked the Israeli military to explain its airstrike on a densely populated refugee camp in Gaza this week, after the attack killed dozens of people, according to U.S. and Israeli officials. The Biden administration requested Israel detail the thinking and process behind the recent strike on the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Northern Gaza, according to a U.S. official, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. Administration officials urged Israel to conduct “precision targeting” in order to avoid harming civilians, the official said. “The U.S. asked for an explanation of the first attack on Jabalia,” said the official, adding that the conversation was in the context of “asking Israel to do more to avoid civilian casualties.” From the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. has asked questions of Israel about their goals and how to achieve them, and urged them to avoid harming civilians, the official stressed. However, U.S. “support for Israel’s right to defend itself remains solid.” Pentagon officials have asked the Israel Defense Forces specifically about the Israeli bombardment of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza on Tuesday, an Israeli official said, adding that Israel “puts a lot of effort into ensuring civilians are out of harm’s way.” A House Democrat familiar with U.S.-Israeli conversations said the administration “has been pushing very hard in private on the Israelis to ease back” — particularly after the bombing of the refugee camp.The House member added Democrats are preliminarily discussing measures to penalize Israel should it not change course, such as “actual enforcement of existing human rights vetting.” “There are mechanisms in place to achieve what we need to achieve,” the lawmaker said, like the Leahy Law that prohibits assistance to countries committing human rights abuses. “Whenever we provide military assistance to partners including Israel … we do make clear that that support must be used consistent with international law, to include the Law of War, and obligations related to protecting civilians,” Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters Thursday. One senior DOD official went a step further, saying that in private conversations, Pentagon officials have been asking the IDF to “think through their operations” and take into account the lives of innocent civilians.",1748,499,282,151344

It wont work as they hang on the words ""were"" and ""werent."" The media have been horrendous in their coverage of the Oct. 7 slaughter of Israeli Jews and their subsequent use of Hamas lies, including the notorious reporting about the Gaza hospital, which they blamed on Israel, the use of Hamas statistics, the regurgitation of Biden administration talking points, and relentless insinuations and worse about Israel and its military killing civilians.  The New York Times and Washington Post essentially covered up the Holocaust as it was occurring.  The Times issued a quasi-apology in 2001 (the Post still has said nothing to the best of my knowledge, some 80 years later).  And the Biden administration is undermining Israels ability to defeat Hamas while claiming to support Israel.  I will not allow the corporate media, and their numerous propagandists, to get away with their hate and lies. Never again will the media be free to push a hateful narrative without pushback from me and conservatives like me.  They can try and use the words ""were"" or ""werent"" to distract from what is really happening, and ask a Biden lapdog staffer for his input, but it will not work.  And the media and Biden have yet to call any of the members of Congress who would not even vote to condemn what happened to the Jews on Oct. 7 antisemites, all but one of whom is a Democrat.  Indeed, when antisemitism has reached historic highs in our country, Biden refuses to call out specific colleges, groups, media personalities, and Democrats for spewing their poison.  Biden and his media are a disgrace, and I will remain unrelenting.  And I encourage all people of good faith, who stand for humanity against terrorism and antisemitism, to join me in saying Never Again.  I will not be intimidated, and neither should any of you!  I told my nephew, when he left our country to go to Israel several weeks ago to fight these terrorists, which he is doing at the this very moment, that I would not sit quietly while the American media turned Israel and its heroic fighters into the perpetrators rather than the defenders, as we knew the media would and, true to form, the media are doing.  And they do the same to Americas military heroes, who I will continue to support and defend without reservation.  There is no price too high for me to pay speaking out in our country against this media-Democrat cabal compared to what the people in Israel are going through.

marklevinshow,"April 15, 2024 12:23 PM","BREAKING!!  I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the lunacy of Biden’s Iran policy.  Biden’s position in refusing to support Israel from taking offensive military action against Iran means that BIDEN WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY MILITARY STRIKES AGAINST IRAN’S NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND THAT IRAN WILL HAVE A FUNCTIONING NUCLEAR ARSENAL WITH WHICH TO THREATEN THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE ARAB WORLD, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WITHOUT FEAR OF MILITARY ATTACK. The best time for Israel to hit Iran’s nuclear sites, with critical U.S. support, would’ve been now.  Biden’s appeasement of Iran and intentional funding of Iran, lack of deterrence against Iran and efforts at crippling Israel’s efforts to neutralize Iran’s military and terrorist operations, ensures that Islamist-fundamentalist Iran will become a nuclear power. And once that occurs there will be few options to limit Iran’s ambitions short of a devastating confrontation with frightening risks. What will we do if Iran closes the Red Sea and other navigable waters used to transport oil? And It will also contribute even further to the firepower of the China-Russia-NK-Iran axis and cause other Middle East countries to acquire nuclear weapons. THIS is the world Biden and Blinken are creating while sanctimoniously lecturing about their efforts to de-escalate military confrontations.  Again, the crucial point is that Biden has not only signaled to Iran that no effective action will be taken to stop its nuclear program but Biden has actually acted to ensure that Iran’s final path to building nuclear weapons is open and clear. That’s what is meant by no support for offensive military action against Iran.  The idea that missile defenses are the answer to preventing offensive strikes against Israel or any country is lunacy. On its face it’s illogical. It’s a deterrent under certain circumstances. Maybe in many circumstances. But ultimately you don’t stop missile attacks by chasing another country’s. You stop missile attacks with certainty by destroying that country’s capacity for launching missiles and/or deterring such attacks by subjecting that country to punishing offensive military attacks. Despite Biden’s massive and current propaganda operation to the contrary, facts are facts.  Furthermore, it’s beyond debate that the duplicitous Biden actually colluded with Iran through intermediaries to create the events that took place in the skies over Israel a few nights ago. And, of course, Israel was in the dark about it. (This is the same Biden regime that outrageously demands tactical approval over Israel’s battlefield decisions.) Why? Because it wouldn’t have gone along with such treachery and put its people through such a heinous subterfuge. Think about how morally corrupt, among other things, the Biden regimes actions truly are.  Biden and the Iranian regime sympathizer, Blinken, coordinated with Iran over the timing, types of missiles, and even Iranian propaganda. The purpose was to prevent Israel from pulverizing Iran’s military capabilities. Indeed, the Biden regime began leaking immediately to their favorite reporters and media outlets (many of the same press sympathizes they relied on during the Obama regime to promote the Iran nuclear deal) that Israel had provoked Iran and hadn’t told the U.S. in advance about the planned attack on Iran’s terrorist compound in Damascus. Obviously, Israel didn’t forewarn Blinken because he would’ve leaked it to the media! Moreover, Israel is not obliged to get permission from Biden on how and whether to defend its people. Biden and Blinken are hostile to Israel and seek to overthrow its democratic government. They’ve repeatedly told this openly to the entire world, including the Iranians.  Every one of these shocking and appalling Biden regime mobster tactics, and there are more, with the attendant scheming, plotting, leaking, usurping, and back-stabbing against a longtime essential and loyal ally, which is in a daunting and bloody war literally triggered by the insane policies of the Biden regime, is beneath contempt and a stain on America’s character and reputation as the world’s moral beacon.  It is Biden and Blinken who are impulsive, ignorant, reckless, incompetent, and dangerous. It is they who’ve abandoned a rational and prudent foreign policy in pursuit of incoherent and ideologically-driven utopian ambitions. And it is they who’ve escalated military conflict on multiple continents. For them, there is no good or evil, right or wrong. Hence, they fund Iran and threaten Israel.

marklevinshow,"September 29, 2024 05:31 PM","None dare call it treason, but me.  Israel is conducting its operations despite the fact that Harris-Biden- Blinken are withholding replacement munitions, ammunition, bombs, and other armaments already approved by Congress, while China, Russia, and North Korea are arming up Iran as fast as possible.  In fact, our corrupt regime has sent more funds to Iran than Israel and has continued to lift sanctions on Iran even though their proxies shoot at our ship and are actively trying to assassinate Donald Trump.  THAT is treasonous.",5771,1891,316,92442
marklevinshow,"September 26, 2024 12:16 PM","Liberty & Tyranny, the November election.  Against all odds, President Trump is still standing. He’s an iconic, historic figure. In a few weeks, we Americans have a rare opportunity to save ourselves from those who hate us or to accept the dark and tyrannical fate Harris and her ilk plan for us.  To be clear, there have been at least 3 assassination attempts on President Trump in the last few months. Butler, Palm Beach & Iran.  The Secret Service in DC reports to Harris-Biden. Its failures are their failures. And as we learn more, the failures are mind-boggling and unbelievable. The buck stops with them. Yet, it literally took an act of Congress after a second assassination attempt for real action to be taken. Why?  And, incredibly, Harris-Biden have been and continue to subsidize the Iranian regime that still seeks to murder President Trump, with billions of dollars, diplomatic support and protection, and the usurpation of Israel — the only country confronting Iranian terrorism — rather than take immediate and deadly military action against Iran’s blatant act of war against our country in its plot against President Trump. Funding and strengthening Trump’s would-be Iranian assassins, granting them visas to enter our country to attend a UN event, accompanied by Secret Service protection, and other forms of aid & comfort, is nothing short of treasonous.  And the relentless, years’ long strategy to dehumanize President Trump, further endangering his life, goes unabated. In fact, it’s justified with righteous indignation by the very poisonous propagandists who practice it - the Harris-Biden regime, its media surrogates, and its party apparatchiks. Indeed, yesterday Biden’s Commerce Secretary openly insisted that President Trump needed to be exterminated. Biden did not fire her. Harris did not demand her resignation. Indeed, neither condemned her. Crickets.  Meanwhile, the multi-front effort to bankrupt President Trump and imprison him, with Democrat prosecutors, Democrat judges, and Democrat juries, continues even in the last days of this campaign, including a new filing by the regime’s enforcers at the DOJ re January 6 before a Trump-hating Obama judge in defiance of a recent Supreme Court ruling. All of which, as intended, is fodder for the Harris campaign — who became her party’s nominee by disenfranchising millions of primary voters, a brazen inter-party coup, and a phony “viral” appointment process that made an open convention impossible.
