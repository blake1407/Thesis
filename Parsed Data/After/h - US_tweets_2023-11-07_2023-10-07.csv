Biden had served in the Senate for almost four decades and then was President of the Senate as Obamas VP. He knew the machinations well. When he ran and promised everything from a minimum wage of $15 to a Public Option for healthcare, he was well aware of the make-up of that chamber at the time.   And then Biden and Dems got TWO MORE Dem senators in Jan 21 in a special election in GA. They were hoping for one but they got both seats. Still, they couldnt get his agenda passed.   So Biden knew Manchin and Sinema were in the Senate when he promised these things, got two additional Dem seats in 2022, and: no minimum wage. Nothing. In fact, he didnt even mention the Public Option once after taking office. Why?  And as far as the min wage goes-  no prime time speech, no barnstorming across the country to build momentum for something that is strongly supported by Democrat, Republican and Independent voters. When he did do a prime time speech, it was an angry diatribe against how mean and evil Trump and the MAGA crowd are. Thats it. No historic push for raising the wage that hasnt been raised in 15 years. Nothing. He just didnt fight, And Kamala? She lied about the Parliamentarian, whose recommendations are never binding.   The fact is, even with a majority bigger than they had planned on, Democrats didnt deliver. They never do. They blame the rotating villain, blame Republicans, and wash their hands. ""But what could we DOO?"".  Fetterman is the new rotating villain. There will be a few others. And this time around, Dems arent even promising anything to the working class. Forget Medicare for All, they wont even talk about the inadequate Public Option.   And that enhanced Child Tax Credit that drastically cut child poverty but expired less than a year after it was put in place? Dems let it lapse. Then they waited for a GOP majority in the House to submit it again. ""OH no!!! The Republicans wont let us help the children!!"". Dems had the majority when the tax credit expired. They could have made it permanent. They waited so they could pin it on Republicans.  But theyll sure as hell move mountains to get billions in weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel. Theyll join hands with Speaker Mike Johnson to do a work-around with Senate and House rules to make sure the wars keep going. But an eviction moratorium when homelessness is spiking 12% in one year? No dice.(But we tried SOOOO hard!!!)  All this is to say that the Democrats arent a true opposition to Republicans. And no matter how big their majority, they never end up fighting for us. Obama could have codified Roe in 2009 like he promised, but somehow didnt see it as a priority once he got in office.  Dems are running on protecting a womans right to abortion and birth control, but dont tell you how theyre going to protect it. All they can do is point to SCOTUS. And be aware, thats on purpose.    Because when it comes down to it,  Democrats dont want to legislate. Theyd rather the courts do it. Remember, it wasnt Democrats who passed marriage equality, it was a conservative court led by a Chief Justice who is a Neanderthal on every other issue.   Dems want the job, but they dont want to do the work. Because when it really comes down to it, they like how things are.   So Im voting Green. Jill Stein for president.

Biden had served in the Senate for almost four decades and then was President of the Senate as Obamas VP. He knew the machinations well. When he ran and promised everything from a minimum wage of $15 to a Public Option for healthcare, he was well aware of the make-up of that chamber at the time.   And then Biden and Dems got TWO MORE Dem senators in Jan 21 in a special election in GA. They were hoping for one but they got both seats. Still, they couldnt get his agenda passed.   So Biden knew Manchin and Sinema were in the Senate when he promised these things, got two additional Dem seats in 2022, and: no minimum wage. Nothing. In fact, he didnt even mention the Public Option once after taking office. Why?  And as far as the min wage goes-  no prime time speech, no barnstorming across the country to build momentum for something that is strongly supported by Democrat, Republican and Independent voters. When he did do a prime time speech, it was an angry diatribe against how mean and evil Trump and the MAGA crowd are. Thats it. No historic push for raising the wage that hasnt been raised in 15 years. Nothing. He just didnt fight, And Kamala? She lied about the Parliamentarian, whose recommendations are never binding.   The fact is, even with a majority bigger than they had planned on, Democrats didnt deliver. They never do. They blame the rotating villain, blame Republicans, and wash their hands. ""But what could we DOO?"".  Fetterman is the new rotating villain. There will be a few others. And this time around, Dems arent even promising anything to the working class. Forget Medicare for All, they wont even talk about the inadequate Public Option.   And that enhanced Child Tax Credit that drastically cut child poverty but expired less than a year after it was put in place? Dems let it lapse. Then they waited for a GOP majority in the House to submit it again. ""OH no!!! The Republicans wont let us help the children!!"". Dems had the majority when the tax credit expired. They could have made it permanent. They waited so they could pin it on Republicans.  But theyll sure as hell move mountains to get billions in weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel. Theyll join hands with Speaker Mike Johnson to do a work-around with Senate and House rules to make sure the wars keep going. But an eviction moratorium when homelessness is spiking 12% in one year? No dice.(But we tried SOOOO hard!!!)  All this is to say that the Democrats arent a true opposition to Republicans. And no matter how big their majority, they never end up fighting for us. Obama could have codified Roe in 2009 like he promised, but somehow didnt see it as a priority once he got in office.  Dems are running on protecting a womans right to abortion and birth control, but dont tell you how theyre going to protect it. All they can do is point to SCOTUS. And be aware, thats on purpose.    Because when it comes down to it,  Democrats dont want to legislate. Theyd rather the courts do it. Remember, it wasnt Democrats who passed marriage equality, it was a conservative court led by a Chief Justice who is a Neanderthal on every other issue.   Dems want the job, but they dont want to do the work. Because when it really comes down to it, they like how things are.   So Im voting Green. Jill Stein for president.
