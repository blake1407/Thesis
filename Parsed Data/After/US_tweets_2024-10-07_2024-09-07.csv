anthonyzenkus,"April 22, 2024 12:29 AM","My response to the official statement released by the White House Deputy Press Secretary on Columbia student protests against the genocide in Gaza.  “While every government has the right to support its allies, giving material support to a nation that the ICJ has said is plausibly committing a genocide and who the UN has determined is starving 2 million people and who is also illegally occupying territory, stealing homes and violently kidnapping adults and children who are predominantly Arab and Muslim is blatantly Islamophobic and racist and is unconscionable, and dangerous – those governments have absolutely no moral standing in the world, especially in the United States of America.   And echoing the rhetoric of the far-right Israeli regime which is perpetrating this genocide in Gaza and who is actively blocking necessary aid from getting through, especially in the wake of their intentional killing of tens of thousands of innocent people, including burying at least 15,000 children under rubble while bombing adults and children in refugee camps, schools, universities, churches, mosques and hospitals as well as the illegal targeted killing of journalists and aid workers, including an American citizen, is despicable.   Additionally, singling out and verbally condemning the peaceful protesters who have courageously demanded an end to the US role in supporting this genocide and the apartheid regime perpetrating it is cowardly and dangerous. For these attacks to eminate from the White House is contemptible.    Furthermore, the weaponization of anti-semitism to demean a popular movement for justice results in both the chilling of free speech and the weakening of the suffering of those who are victims of actual antisemitism. We condemn these actions and statements in the strongest terms.”",2847,1255,203,81460

anthonyzenkus,"August 29, 2024 10:04 PM","Liberals on twitter are blaming Trump for weakening food safety inspections, leading to the Boars Head lysteria outbreak which has claimed 8 lives so far. They are correct, however, not one of them has even questioned why Biden didnt fix this problem when he could have.  1. Trump weakened safety inspections by ordering the USDA to change the way food inspections were done. Food processors were allowed to inspect themselves and report back to the USDA, a disaster in the making.   2. Trump was able to do this as the executive branch has broad powers over how regulatory agencies enforce the law  3. Biden had the same power to order the USDA to resume proper inspections on Day 1. He did not  4. He wouldnt have needed Congress to do that, as I pointed out, Trump weakened the regulations using executive power and Biden could have fixed them the same way. Even if Congress was  a question, which it wasnt, Dems held the majority in both houses at the time. Again, it didnt matter because changing USDA practices is something presidents can do.  5. Some liberals on Twitter/X have used the SCOTUS Chevron decision as an excuse for Biden not acting on food inspections. Chevron wouldnt pertain to having the agency resume proper inspections. and even if it did, Chevron didnt happen until this summer- Biden has been president for 3.5 years.   This represents the bigger problem with Democrats in a nutshell. Republicans do something awful, Democrats have the power to change or fix it and decide not to.   Ive heard all sorts of excuses on this. ""Biden was handling the pandemic"", or ""he was cleaning up Trumps mess"". Handling the pandemic doesnt preclude a president from ordering USDA to resume proper inspections. And if cleaning up ""Trumps mess"" doesnt include making sure our food doesnt poison us, what does??  The lockstep liberals are never willing to hold Democrats accountable. Dems dont use their power when they have it, and their supporters make tons of excuses as to why they cant do a certain thing.  Fixing the problems that Republicans create is the mantra Dems use to get elected. But then they never fix them and liberal supporters throw their hands up saying ""but what could we do?""  Some liberals on this platform suggested that if Biden ordered USDA to fix the problem,  Republicans would have obstructed.  Again, Congress isnt needed for a president to change the way inspections are done. Again,  Democrats had a majority. But this is the real problem: are liberals saying that a threat of republican blow back means Democrats shouldnt act? This is ridiculous on its face. Trump didnt worry about Democrats pushback when he deregulated, but Democrats cant do the right thing because ""maybe Republicans would pushback""? smdh  Maybe the Democrats in the Congress were okay with the changes. Maybe Biden-Harris didnt want to fix it in the first place.   All we know is that Biden-Harris didnt act when they could have, and now people are sick and some have died. Blame Trump, but dont you dare ask why Dems didnt fix it.  This is the same thing that happened with the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Trump deregulation contributed to that disaster - But Biden had been in office for 2 years when it happened and hadnt fixed those regulatory issues. He hadnt even tried.   They still havent. They are leaving it up to Congress. Every chance they get, Democrats, especially Biden-Harris, abdicate their responsibility and just blame the Republicans for being terrible and obstructing.  They do the same thing on abortion. Yes, the overturning of Roe V Wade is a disaster, but why wont Biden-Harris open up abortion clinics on federal lands? Its within their power to do so, but they wont do it. Better to just blame Republicans and not even try to fix the problem   When it comes down to it, Dems dont even try.   This is why the two party system is a farce.   This is why Im voting for Jill Stein.",1680,592,95,31445

JoJoFromJerz,"June 26, 2024 02:23 PM","The New York Times claims Liberals are “burnt out” right now when it comes to the election. That we’re “exhausted.”  So, let’s talk about that shall we.  Because you see, my 11-year old daughter has fewer rights today than I did at her age and I know that if we get this election wrong, what remains at present of her right to bodily autonomy will be taken from her too. I know that if we get this election wrong, that there won’t be a blue state she can go to for an abortion, not even one which would save her life. I know that she likely will be forced, along with all women and every other girl her age, to enter her menstrual cycles into a federal database so the government can track her “ability to breed”, and I know that she won’t have access to IVF or contraception. I know that those realities aren’t hyperbolic musings based on a hunch. I know, because they’ve told us what they’ll do. They tell us every single day. So while I’d really love to tap the fuck out right now, unfortunately, it just ain’t an option.  You see, I don’t have the luxury of being “burnt out”, because the other side is really fucking busy banning books, whitewashing history, arming teachers, normalizing school shootings, glorifying extrajudicial violence, weaponizing court picks, undermining justice, emboldening intolerance, dismantling democracy, rolling back the clock on women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights and the rights of every single already marginalized minority group in this country while stoking racism, sexism and xenophobia at the same damn time.   They’re out there trying to make it easier to marry a child, easier to pray in school, easier to discriminate, easier to keep people from voting, easier to get your hands on a weapon of war, easier to put a teenager to work in a meat packing plant, easier for women to be abused, easier to deny science, easier to keep information and education out of the hands of the masses, all while also doing everything they can to make it easier for a sociopathic fucking traitor to take control of a government he not so long ago, tried to overthrow.  I’m too worried about my gay friends, my trans friends, my Latino friends, my Jewish and my Arab friends to let any amount of exhaustion make me quit.  I’m too worried that the Supreme Court a rapist got to seat 1/3 of, seems hell bent on rewarding that same traitorous sexual predator with the ability to commit murder at will, just so long as it means THEY still get their fancy fishing trips and mortgages paid.  I’m too worried about more school shootings, mall shootings, movie theater shootings, parade, doctor’s office, grocery store, church and concert shootings to just give up.  I’m a single mom of two kids. I’m always fucking tired. I wake up fucking tired. And yes, it is extra fucking exhausting to have to constantly contend with the hateful, cruel, regressive agenda being imposed upon us by a bunch of Christofascist white dudes who know their fragile hold on power is being taken from their old man hands because the world continues to evolve around them. But I am not now, nor will I ever be “burnt out” on defending this democracy.  And I know for a fact that I am not alone. There are tens of millions of us who feel the same damn way.

These are the words of Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for decades.  As you watch the death and destruction that is currently unfolding in Israel and Palestine, its important for you to know that the Israeli government is responsible for the rise of Hamas.  If it wasnt for Israels government, Hamas might not even exist at all.  Starting in the late 1970s, the Israeli government decided that they wanted a radical Islamist ""counterweight"" to the PLO, which was run by Yasser Arafats secularist and left-wing Fatah party.   Their thinking was that, if the Palestinians were busy fighting each other, they wouldnt be able to fight Israel. Divide and conquer.  Starting in the late 1970s, they began giving direct funding to a fringe group of radicals, their organizations, and their mosques.  One of them was Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza, who had also formed the Islamist group Mujama al-Islamiya. They were recognized as a charity by the Israeli government in 1979, and started receiving funding soon after.  Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor in Gaza at the time, said that he was given a budget to fund these mosques and organizations, and was told to give them preferential treatment over the PLO.  Cohen wrote an official report to his superiors in the 1980s, where he warned them against continuing this strategy. “I suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,” he wrote at the time.  They didnt listen.  In 1987, those groups formed Hamas, and the rest is history.  Thousands of innocent Israelis and Palestinians killed.  And as we see today, that death count continues to rise.  Its important to note that the US government gives billions of dollars to the Israeli government, and hundreds of millions to the Palestinian authority.  American taxpayers are being forced to bankroll the carnage youre currently witnessing.  Its long past time for that to end.  Foreign military aid is the act of taking money from working Americans, and giving it to rich, powerful foreigners, to fund wars, genocides, terrorism and other horrors.

TomFitton,"October 26, 2023 09:12 PM","October 24, 2023  VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION The Honorable Merrick Garland Attorney General Department of Justice The Honorable Christopher Wray Director Federal Bureau of Investigation  Dear Attorney General Garland and Director Wray:  Since July 25, 2022, I have requested information from  the Justice Department and FBI with respect to legally protected whistleblower disclosures  that informed my office of political bias infecting the decision-making process in investigations related to the Biden family. 1 Since that date, the Justice Department and FBI have failed to provide responsive records. This letter is based on years of investigation, including the provision of information, records, and allegations from multiple Justice Department whistleblowers that indicate there is - and has been - an effort among certain Justice Department and FBI officials to improperly delay and stop full and complete investigative activity into the Biden family, including but not limited to FD-1023s referencing the Biden family. This alleged political infection breaks faith with the American people, and it will ruin our governmental institutions should it continue. As just one initial example, Ive been made aware that at one point in time the FBI maintained over 40 Confidential Human Sources that provided criminal information relating to Joe Biden, James Biden, and Hunter Biden. An essential question that must be answered is this: did the FBI investigate the information or shut it down? Indeed, if those sources were improperly shut down, it wouldnt be out of the ordinary for the FBI, as this letter will address.  By way of initial background, since August 2019, Senator Johnson and I have investigated the Biden familys foreign financial dealings and business arrangements. On September 23, 2020, and November 18, 2020, we issued reports detailing our findings based in part on hundreds of Treasury Department Suspicious Activity Reports, transcribed interviews, and thousands of pages of Obama/Biden administration government records. Our findings indicated potential criminal activity, to include money laundering, with respect to members of the Biden family and their business associates as well as strong financial connections to questionable foreign nationals and foreign government-linked corporate entities. Then, in March and April of 2022, we gave three speeches on the Senate Floor and made public bank records supporting the same findings and further connecting the Biden family business to businesses linked to the communist Chinese government. After that, on October 26, 2022, Senator Johnson and I provided hundreds of pages of bank records to U.S. Attorney Weiss connecting the Biden family to Chinese-government linked entities. Since August 2019, the Justice Department and FBI have refused to answer our questions, cooperate with our investigation, and have made every effort to obstruct and frustrate legitimate and constitutional congressional oversight.  On July 25, 2022, I wrote to the both of you.5 In that letter, I described whistleblower allegations that the FBI developed information in 2020 about Hunter Biden s criminal financial and related activity but ultimately shut it down based on false assertions that it was subject to foreign disinformation. Its been alleged that the basis for shutting the investigative activity down was an August 2020 assessment created by FBI Supervisory Intelligence Analyst Brian Auten. That assessment was used by an FBI HQ team to improperly discredit negative Hunter Biden information as disinformation and caused investigative activity to cease. The precise basis for how the FBI HQ team selected the specific information for inclusion in Autens assessment is unknown, but the focus of the FBI HQ teams attention involved derogatory information about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.  In that same letter, I noted that in October 2020, an avenue of derogatory Hunter Biden reporting was ordered closed at the direction of Assistant Special Agent in Charge Tim Thibault. My office has been made aware that FBI agents responsible for the information that was shut down were interviewed by the FBI HQ team in furtherance of Autens assessment. Publicly released portions ofThibaults interview with the House Judiciary Committee confirm the whistleblower allegations. The transcript reportedly notes that an FBI HQ and FBI Baltimore element wanted the Hunter Biden reporting closed, which Thibault followed through on.  On October 13, 2022, I wrote to the both of you and U.S. Attorney Weiss with respect to specific records within the possession of the Justice Department and FBI indicating potential criminal activity in the Biden familys foreign business deals. This included the Biden family 1023 that Chairman Comer and I ultimately made public on July 25, 2023. Specifically, I requested an array of records relating to that Biden family 1023. While all three recipients of my letter have failed to provide the requested information, none have disputed the allegations Ive presented to them.  Although investigative activity was scuttled by the FBI in 2020, the origins of additional activity relate back to years earlier. For example, in December 2019, the FBI Washington Field Office closed a ""205B"" Kleptocracy case, 205B-~ Serial 7, into Mykola Zlochevsky, owner of Burisma, which was opened in January 2016 by a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FBI squad based out of the FBIs Washington Field Office. This Foreign Corrupt Practices Act squad included agents from FBI HQ. In February 2020, a meeting took place at the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office with FBI HQ elements. That meeting involved discussion about investigative matters relating to the Hunter Biden investigation and related inquiries, which most likely wouldve included the case against Zlochevsky. Then, in March 2020 and at the request of the Justice Department, a ""Guardian"" Assessment was opened out of the Pittsburgh Field Office to analyze information provided by Rudy Giuliani.  During the course of that assessment, Justice Department and FBI officials located an FD-1023 from March 1, 2017, relating to the ""205B"" Kleptocracy investigation of Zlochevsky. That FD-1023 included a reference to Hunter Biden being on the board of Burisma, which the handling agent deemed at the time non-relevant information to the ongoing criminal financial case. And when that FD-1023 was discovered, Justice Department and FBI officials asked the handler for the Confidential Human Source (CHS) to re-interview that CHS. According to reports, there was ""a fight for a month"" to get the handler to re-interview the CHS. Eventually, that re-interview took place and the Biden family 1023 about the alleged criminal scheme between then-Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, and Zlochevsky was created in June 2020. A 1023 must be serialized to a case, so that Biden family 1023 was serialized to the Pittsburgh Assessment. Accordingly, claims that the Biden family 1023 was part of the information provided by Giuliani are incorrect. The information in the Biden family 1023 was obtained separate from Giuliani from a long-standing, high-paid FBI CHS whos been used in other investigative matters by the FBI, as the Zlochevsky case illustrates. That Biden family 1023 was serialized into the Pittsburgh Assessment simply because it was the administrative avenue to house the source information.  Due to the fact there was no case and merely an assessment, Justice Department and FBI officials were limited in their investigative abilities including conducting database checks instead of using subpoenas and search warrants. In addition, my office has been informed that the FBI agents and DOJ officials working the Pittsburgh Assessment had to pause their work for weeks at a time because the assessment had to be reapproved every 30 days by multiple DOJ and FBI officials. On June 30, 2020, the Biden family 1023 was serialized into the Pittsburgh Assessment, and FBI leadership would likely have been briefed on it due to the nature of the reporting. Either on that day or shortly thereafter, travel mentioned in the Biden family 1023 was confirmed as well as some meetings that took place.  In August 2020, and possibly earlier, Supervisory Intelligence Analyst Brian Auten opened the aforementioned assessment, which was used by the Foreign Influence Task Force to seek out CHS holdings at FBI Field Offices across the country relating to the Biden family and falsely discredit them as foreign disinformation. Also, in August 2020, the Foreign Influence Task Force improperly briefed me and Senator Johnson with respect to our Biden family investigation after pressure from congressional Democrats. That improper briefing was used by Democrats and the partisan media to falsely claim our investigation, which was based on Obama/Biden administration records, was impacted by foreign disinformation.   On September 3, 2020, the Pittsburgh Assessment was closed - after a mere six months- and on September 14, 2020, the Foreign Influence Task Force communicated with the handling agent for the Biden family 1023. According to information provided to my office, the Foreign Influence Task Force attempted to shut down that reporting by falsely saying it was subject to foreign disinformation. It should be emphasized that the basis for trying to shut down the Biden family 1023 has been described to my office as highly suspect and is contradicted by other documents my office has been told exist within the Foreign Influence Task Force, FBI Seattle Field Office, FBI Baltimore Field Office, and FBI HQ holdings.  On September 21, 2020, after closure of the Pittsburgh Assessment, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady transmitted a report to Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Rich Donoghue summarizing the findings of the FBI assessment. The subject line of that report stated, ""VETTING."" According to information provided to my office, the officials involved in the assessment had limited ability to verify all information in the Biden family 1023 because the Justice Department did not authorize them to use a grand jury and, therefore, they didnt have all the tools at their disposal to run the information to ground, including subpoenas to obtain documents and interviews. However, the report included a recommendation that additional investigative activity be done. Notably, my office has been informed that, with respect to the CHS in the Biden family 1023, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania coordinated with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in 2020 and found no hits to known sources of Russian disinformation. The report, including information on the Biden family 1023, was ultimately transmitted to U.S. Attorney Weiss who, according to Attorney General Garland, had every investigative tool at his disposal even before being designated as a special counsel.   Since making the Biden family 1023 public on July 25, 2023, its been made clear by former Attorney General Barr, Director Wray, and Deputy Director Abbate that the 1023 is part of an ongoing investigative matter, indicating its investigative credibility and authenticity. As such, its essential that we examine the alleged attempts by FBI personnel to sweep it under the rug, as well as what steps U.S. Attorney Weiss has taken to use the document for his ongoing investigation.  On October 5, 2020, Supervisory Special Agent Eric Miller and Assistant Special Agent in Charge Thibault participated in a call with the Washington Field Office; Baltimore Field Office; Wilmington, Delaware FBI agents; and FBI management personnel. That call allegedly included Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alfred Watson, Supervisory Special Agent Joe Gordon, Special Agent Susan Roepcke and Special Agent Joshua Wilson. Notably, FBI agents from the Baltimore Field Office were attached to U.S. Attorney Weisss investigation. My office has been informed that on that call it was confirmed the Delaware case currently run by U.S. Attorney Weiss was opened as a money laundering and Foreign Agents Registration Act case, not a bribery case as the Biden family 1023 would appear to require, and that it was jointly worked with the IRS. On that call, it was made clear that Delaware FBI agents were in possession of email evidence that contradicted denials made by Joe Biden that he was never aware of or involved in Hunter Bidens business arrangements.  On October 23, 2020, Tony Bobulinski met with and was interviewed by James Dawson, a Washington Field Office Special Agent in Charge, Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge Giulio Arseni, Special Agent William Novak, and Special Agent Garrett Churchill. Bobulinski provided first-hand knowledge as an eye and ear witness to Joe Bidens involvement in potentially criminal schemes with Hunter Biden. Notably, on October 13, 2022, I wrote a letter to the both of you and U.S. Attorney Weiss with respect to a summary of Bobulinskis FBI interview that my staff reviewed which included, in part, reference to the Bidens receiving an unsecured $5 million loan, intended to be forgivable, from CEFC in 2017 that would serve as payment for actions Joe Biden took during his vice presidency. This financial strategy to illegally treat income as a loan is consistent with IRS whistleblower testimony that indicated Hunter Biden attempted the same with respect to other income, including payments received from Burisma.  Also on October 23, 2020, Justice Department and FBI Special Agents from the Pittsburgh Field Office briefed Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesley Wolf, one of U.S. Attorney Weisss top prosecutors, and FBI Special Agents from the Baltimore Field Office with respect to the contents of the Biden family 1023. However, the meeting did not include any IRS agents, and AUSA Wolf prevented investigators from seeking information about Joe Biden s involvement in Hunter Bidens criminal arrangements.  Based on the information provided to my office over a period of years by multiple credible whistleblowers, there appears to be an effort within the Justice Department and FBI to shut down investigative activity relating to the Biden family. Such decisions point to significant political bias infecting the decision-making of not only the Attorney General and FBI Director, but also line agents and prosecutors. Our Republic cannot survive such a political infection and you have an obligation to this country to clear the air.  Accordingly, based on the aforementioned information, Ive obtained the names of 25 DOJ and FBI personnel to interview at a future date, some of whom are named above, who either had a direct or indirect role in the allegations described above. In addition, please provide the requested information no later than November 17, 2023:  1.

TomFitton,"November 28, 2023 05:00 AM","UPDATE: President Trumps lawyers pushing for hearing and fact-finding on their claims that Biden and the DOJ are engaging in a  selective and vindictive prosecution of President Trump.  Below is their ""reply"" brief (filed on November 22) on the issue (without footnotes):   PRESIDENT TRUMP’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS FOR SELECTIVE AND VINDICTIVE PROSECUTION  President Donald J. Trump respectfully submits this reply in further support of his motion to dismiss the indictment based on selective and vindictive prosecution.  Dubbing team members “career prosecutors” does not insulate the activities of the Special Counsel’s Office from judicial or public scrutiny. The reliable media reports submitted by President Trump, which are based on information from other “career prosecutors” and government officials, demonstrate the unconstitutional nature of the investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office and the line prosecutors. If the “career prosecutors” in this case wanted to dispute the content of those reports, there was a straightforward way to do so: submit declarations by first- hand witnesses denying the operative facts under oath. If, for example, the New York Times falsely reported that President Biden told others that President Trump “should be prosecuted,” then why not give the Court and the public peace of mind through the submission of competent evidence, rather than a blustering brief that is full of venom but deflects on the core facts?  The answer is simple. The media reports are accurate. Thus, despite all of the Special Counsel’s self-aggrandizing comments about the supposedly unprecedented nature of his manufactured allegations against President Trump, the truly unprecedented aspect of this case is that a sitting president successfully urged the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to try to take down his chief political rival and, now, the leading candidate to be the next president. President Biden was so successful, in fact, that the Special Counsel brought two deeply flawed cases against President Trump and has engaged in a reckless effort to proceed to trial in both as soon as possible—even while President Biden anxiously waits to learn whether he will be charged with crimes by a different Special Counsel.  The Biden Administration may not, through this prosecution, retaliate against President Trump for speaking out or for exercising his constitutional right to run for office. Nor may the prosecutors do President Biden’s impermissible bidding. Because the Special Counsel’s Office has not submitted evidence to refute—or even dispute—President Trump’s proof regarding the biased and unconstitutional purpose of this case, the Court should dismiss the indictment. In the alternative, the Court must conduct further fact finding.  I. There Is Much More Than An “Indication” Of Insidious Bias The Special Counsel’s Office declares without basis that “the factual and legal record contain absolutely no indication of selective or vindictive prosecution.” Doc. 141 at 1. That is not accurate.  First, evidence of the insidious and unconstitutional bias at the heart of the prosecution team in this case emerged within days of the 2020 election. On November 12, 2020, Deputy Special Counsel J.P. Cooney and Senior Assistant Special Counsel Molly Gaston signed a letter to then-Attorney General Bill Barr in which they declared that allegations regarding election fraud were “false.” Cooney and Gaston signed that letter as Assistant United States Attorneys at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia without any basis in fact or any investigation to support their sweeping claim.  Cooney and Gaston are now prosecuting the indictment in this case, in which they have alleged that “senior leaders of the Justice Department . . told President Trump on multiple occasions that various allegations of fraud were unsupported.” Doc. 1 ¶ 11(b). For Cooney and Gaston, at least, this outcome was predetermined before mid-November 2020. What followed, then, cannot accurately be characterized as a “thorough and impartial investigation guided by facts and applicable law.” Doc. 141 at 1. Rather, as the unrebutted facts make clear, the prosecutors decided to charge President Trump regardless of the facts:  · In February 2021, Cooney proposed a “wide-ranging effort” to target President Trump that concerned even the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). Doc. 116-1 at 5. Cooney’s proposal was ultimately rejected because, among other things, it “treaded on First Amendment-protected activities.” Id. · During the same month, then-acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Michael Sherwin began “agitating” for a “hammer,” while physically carrying the seditious conspiracy statute around his office. Doc. 116-1 at 6. · In March 2021, during a 60 Minutes interview in violation of DOJ policy, Sherwin declared publicly that President Trump was being targeted by DOJ and suggested that statements from “soccer moms” had “moved the needle.” · In November 2021, Senior Assistant Special Counsel Thomas Windom put forward an investigative proposal targeting President Trump’s close associates, which was met with “flat rejection,” with one FBI official declaring, “You don’t have enough to issue subpoenas.” Doc. 116-1 at 9. · In the weeks that followed, rather than recognizing the lack of evidentiary basis for grand jury proceedings, Windom “discreetly” asked a different agency if it “might help” with the biased project the FBI had declined to pursue. Doc. 116-1 at 9.  Second, as President Trump criticized the Biden Administration and suggested that he would run in the 2024 election, President Biden urged his “inner circle” that President Trump “was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted.” Doc. 116-2. President Biden also said privately that he wanted the Attorney General to “act less like a ponderous judge and more like a prosecutor who is willing to take decisive action.” Id. The Biden administration intentionally leaked these comments to the media in early 2022 so that President Biden could improperly provide instructions to and exert pressure on prosecutors and investigators without engaging in direct communications, as is clear from the fact that the article sourced the operative remark to “two people familiar with his comments.” Id.  Unmoved by such intimidation tactics, President Trump maintained his criticism of the Biden Administration, leading to a groundswell of support for President Trump’s 2024 candidacy. On November 9, 2022, just days before President Trump announced his candidacy, President Biden issued a final ultimatum: “we just have to demonstrate that he will not take power . . if he does run.” Doc. 116 at 4. President Biden’s threat was clear. If President Trump chose to “run,” President Biden would bring the force of the government down on President Trump. Id.  Once again undeterred, President Trump announced his candidacy. Then, President Biden made good on his threat. Within days of President Trump’s announcement, the Attorney General appointed the Special Counsel, who filed a false indictment against President Trump in Florida in June 2023. After President Trump publicly criticized President Biden and the Special Counsel for engaging in prosecutorial misconduct and improperly weaponizing law enforcement to harm his campaign, see Docs. 116-3, 116-4, this indictment followed.  II. The Motions Are Supported By Evidence The Special Counsel’s Office has relied on media reports from the Washington Post and other sources throughout this case when the prosecution approved of the reports’ substance.  Because President Trump relies on two articles the Office appears not to like, at least in public, the prosecution seeks to relegate them to the level of “spurious allegations contrived from two newspaper articles citing anonymous sources.” Doc. 141 at 1. The Court should see through that ploy.  The reports at issue are not, as the prosecution claims, based on “rumor and innuendo.” Doc. 141 at 6. The Washington Post article is “based on internal documents, court files, congressional records, handwritten contemporaneous notes, and interviews with more than two dozen current and former prosecutors, investigators, and others with knowledge of the probe.” Doc. 116-1 at 3. The New York Times article is attributed to “interviews with more than a dozen people, including officials in the Biden administration and people with knowledge of the president’s thinking, all of whom asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations.” Doc. 116-2 at 2. For example, President Biden’s instruction that President Trump “should be prosecuted” is sourced to “two people familiar with his comments.” Id.  Citing United States v. Khanu, 664 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 2009), the prosecution argues that the media reports are “insufficient.” Doc. 141 at 10. In Khanu, the court found that the defendant’s evidence was “too far removed from the actual prosecuting authorities in this case.” 664 F. Supp. at 34. Here, the proffered evidence directly implicates President Biden as well as the line prosecutors. Accordingly, in the absence of first-hand declarations to the contrary, there is no basis for disregarding or diminishing the evidence submitted by President Trump in support of his motions.  III. The Presumption of Regularity Does Not Apply  The presumption of regularity that the Special Counsel seeks to hide behind is entitled to no weight under these circumstances. See, e.g., Doc. 141 at 2, 4. The presumption arises in ordinary cases because prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility” under the Take Care Clause, i.e., every president’s constitutional obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996); U.S. Const., Art. II, § 3. In this case, President Biden has driven a prosecution that is wholly inconsistent with that Clause and is instead motivated by a constitutionally prohibited desire to pursue election interference by punishing President Trump for his protected speech, his decision to run for office, and his status as the leading candidate in the 2024 election. The evidence also demonstrates that the prosecutors at times acted based on a similar political bias, which led them to make unsupported assertions and press for investigative steps that violated the Constitution. Thus, there exists the type of “clear evidence to the contrary” that warrants setting aside the presumption of regularity. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (cleaned up).  IV. The Motion Establishes a Prima Facie Cases of Selective Prosecution Once the presumption is appropriately stripped way, this extraordinary fact pattern, coupled with the history of prosecutorial inaction in connection with controversial presidential transitions and other elections, is sufficient for President Trump to make out a prima facie case of selective prosecution.  The case is unconstitutionally “selective” and motivated by a “discriminatory purpose,” United States v. Eshetu, 2023 WL 7384996, at 12 (D.D.C. 2023), because the Biden administration singled out President Trump based on unconstitutional considerations and the Special Counsel’s Office has acted at President Biden’s inappropriate direction. The Office claims that none of the seven other elections identified by President Trump as comparators “involved deceitful and corrupt efforts to defeat a government function or block the certification of the legitimate results of a presidential election.” Doc. 141 at 7. However, a law review article cited by the Office describes the 1800 election as having involved protracted and intentional delay by Federalists in the House of Representatives, “a growing threat of indefinite deadlock,” and “fear of a constitutional crisis and possible armed revolt.” Rami Fakhouri, The Most Dangerous Blot in Our Constitution: Retiring the Flawed Electoral College ‘Contingent Procedure’, 104 Nw. U. L. Rev. 705, 717-18 (2010), cited in Doc. 139 at 57. The prosecutors’ efforts to distinguish the 1800 election boil down to a wrongful political judgment, in a politically motivated case, that Jefferson’s “conviction” regarding the outcome was sincere, whereas President Trump’s was not. See Doc. 139 at 56. Similar self-serving, discretionary judgments pervade the Office’s efforts to distinguish the other six elections cited by President Trump. These are not the sort of distinctions that can defeat a selective prosecution motion in light of the record regarding the investigation and prosecution at issue.  Seeking to deflect, the Special Counsel’s Office declares that individuals prosecuted in the physical-presence cases relating to January 6 are “obvious comparators closer at hand.” Doc. 141 at 8. However, none of those cases involved the package of charges levied against President Trump or focused on speaking out against election fraud and irregularities, as opposed to physically entering the Capitol. Consequently, even the politically motivated prosecutors responsible for this case did not dare bring the seditious conspiracy charge that Sherwin pre-selected. Moreover, the prosecution’s impermissible motives are laid bare by the citation to the Rhodes case. Doc. 141 at 8. In March 2022, before President Biden’s declaration that President Trump must be prosecuted, DOJ prosecutors argued that Rhodes acted independently of President Trump. See, e.g., Doc. 156 at 12 (prosecutor describing evidence of “an intent to fight to stop that result with or without somebody like President Trump calling them into action”); see also id. (prosecutor arguing in summation that “Mr. Rhodes was clear in these open letters that if President Trump didn’t take action, he and his co-conspirators would,” and that “the President didn’t take action”). Now that President Trump is the leading candidate in the 2024 election, the prosecution argues that President Trump and Rhodes are similarly situated. This tack only supports President Trump’s motion.  V. The Motion Establishes a Prima Facie Cases of Vindictive Prosecution President Trump has also made the required showing of vindictiveness. A case cited by the Special Counsel’s Office establishes that a defendant can meet his burden through evidence that the prosecutor “was prevailed upon to bring the charges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a ‘stalking horse.’” See Doc. 141 at 4-5 (quoting United States v. Sanders, 211 F.3d 711, 717 (2d Cir. 2000)). That is precisely what President Trump has demonstrated through President Biden’s public statements and news reports based on leaks from former members of the prosecution team. The Special Counsel is President Biden’s stalking horse in highly publicized cases in this District and in Florida, and line prosecutors took politically biased steps during the investigation that suggest they also have personal stakes in the outcome. See United States v. Meyer, 810 F.2d 1242, 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“A presumption of vindictiveness will lie in the pretrial setting if the defendant presents facts sufficient to show a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness.”); United States v. Slatten, 865 F.3d 767, 799-800 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (reasoning that “particularly in an important, highly publicized case, a prosecutor being but human may have a personal stake in obtaining a conviction and a motivation to engage in self-vindication” serve as “additional facts that support the finding of a presumption” of vindictiveness). The inference of vindictiveness is further supported by the fact that—before President Trump declared his candidacy and President Biden urged for his prosecution—DOJ declined a proposal by the National Archives to investigate the use of electors in the 2020 election and alleged “documents that Trump used to pressure Pence not to certify the election for Biden.” Doc. 116-1 at 6; see also id. at 9 (noting that “the FBI wasn’t ready to move forward” on so-called “fake electors” following Windom’s November 2021 presentation).  The Special Counsel’s Office contends that an inference of vindictiveness is less appropriate in pretrial settings, such as this one, because this is “a time when the prosecutor’s assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized.” Doc. 141 at 5. To the extent the prosecutors’ “crystallization” is relevant, it only supports dismissal. The Office recently suggested that it will seek to offer evidence of the January 6 violence at the Capitol at trial in this case, which is a position the prosecution announced only after President Trump made public statements criticizing the prosecution and filed pretrial motions defending himself.  VI. At Minimum, Fact Finding Is Necessary to Resolve These Motions The prosecution suggests that President Trump must provide “exceptionally clear proof” to obtain a hearing on these motions. Doc. 141 at 10. That is not the law. See, e.g., United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2002) (“A defendant who seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Oseguera Gonzalez, 507 F. Supp. 3d 137, 175 (D.D.C. 2020) (applying selective-prosecution standard for discovery to vindictive prosecution claim).  On the selective prosecution motion, some courts have “lowered the standard for discovery in selective-enforcement cases by jettisoning the ‘similarly situated’ requirement for the discriminatory-effect prong and abandoning the discriminatory-intent prong entirely.” Eshetu, 2023 WL 7384996, at 12. Regardless, under either formulation, President Trump has met the “some evidence” standard. See, e.g., United States v. Rashed, 234 F.3d 1280, 1286 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“As a condition of discovery, to adduce ‘some evidence tending to show the essential elements of’ the defense ” (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 462)). President Trump has also established a “realistic likelihood of vindictiveness,” which the prosecution must “attempt to rebut” through actual evidence rather than unsworn assertions in a memorandum of law. Slatten, 865 F.3d at 799.  Finally, the Special Counsel’s Office professes confusion about what the fact finding “would entail” and claims that it requires a “rough sketch.” Doc. 141 at 14. The Supreme Court has provided one, in a case the Office cited: “the Government must assemble from its own files documents which might corroborate or refute the defendant’s claim.” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. So too have our discovery requests. See Ex. 2 (10/23/23 Requests 10-12, 24, 39-40, 43, 55). There is no mystery about what the prosecution must do if it seeks to establish that this case is based on permissible motives, which it clearly is not.  CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, and the reasons set forth in our opening brief, President Trump respectfully submits that the indictment should be dismissed on the basis of selective and vindictive prosecution. In the alternative, the Court should hold a hearing to develop the record regarding due process violations by the Special Counsel’s Office.",4071,1419,97,151618
