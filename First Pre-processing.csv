RealSpikeCohen,Libertarian Party,222100,"Just over a month ago, the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio caused metric tons of toxic chemicals to spew into the air and water.   Many locals are already suffering health issues as a result, and tens of thousands pets and wildlife have been reported dead.I am infinitely more concerned with the raging chemical fire in East Palestine OH then I am with NORAD playing whack-a-mole with balloons.Jew here.  Words mean things.  When everything is called antisemitic, it helps provide cover for actual antisemitism.","""Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel’s creation.""  These are the words of Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for decades.  As you watch the death and destruction that is currently unfolding in Israel and Palestine, its important for you. Jewish organizations such as If Not Now and Jewish Voices for Peace have been organizing rallies across the US calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.  The head of the ADL has called these Jewish groups ""hate groups"" and accused them of ""antisemitism"".  The ADL is defaming Jews.  Even. As recently as 2020, the Israeli government was begging Arab governments to continue funding Hamas.  Ask yourself why theyd do that.  Ask yourself why the most secure border on earth fell to people on paragliders.  Consider who this war benefits:  - Netanyahu, whose corruption. For the people who read this, and somehow think Im defending Hamas, or defending the killing of innocent Israelis, or claiming the killing didnt happen, or some other nonsense that I never said or implied:.

ComicDaveSmith,Libertarian Party,570400,"If you were on a mission to create more antisemitism in this country, you couldn’t do a better job than the ADL.Isn’t it crazy that almost no one in the political or media class talk about radical Islamic terrorism anymore. There’s no concern about it, and yet every emergency power that the government took in the name of terrorism, DHL, TSA, Patriot act, is just part of America now.You cannot possibly compare NATOs interventions to Russias invasions. It requires both a deliberate ignorance of the scale and to deliberately ignore the history of Russian genocide in Ukraine.  Dont deliberately ignore the history of Russian genocide in Ukraine.","As the Israeli assault on Gaza becomes even more transparently indefensible, I’d like to take on the three main “justifications” that I get the most.  1) They have to finish the job! Hamas must be defeated!  The obvious moral hypocrisy of believing that you are justified in. It’s pretty amazing. I’ve spent the last week talking about the conditions that led to the Hamas terrorist attack, mainly Israel’s occupation and Israel’s support of Hamas. I’ve been speaking out against the current war, where over a million children’s lives hang in the balance.The Hamas attack on Israel was horrific, criminal and so stupid. It guarantees further suffering for their own people.  The problem in America is that most people have a simplistic view of the situation that is completely removed from reality. They assume normal relations and. I see a lot of critics of Israel, who I respect very much, celebrating the ICJ ruling. It seems to me that they totally bitched out. They could have ordered an immediate ceasefire and instead they told Israel to make sure they don’t do anymore genocide and that they have a. "

Contact your representatives and tell them they support an illegal occupation!. JUST IN: ICJ Rules by a vote of 14-1 that Israels occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and must evacuate settlers/immediately halt all new settlement activities. Hes right. A ceasefire also doesnt stop land expansion in the West Bank. Doesnt stop the torture of Palestinian prisoners. Doesnt stop apartheid either. This is why politicians are trying to limit the discussion to October 7th.Calling for a ceasefire or arms embargo at this point is farcical.  Then what? We go back to ""normal"" i.e. occupation until the next slaughter?  The only fair and legal remedy under intl law is decolonization.

I have no doubt that had it not been public pressure, these statement would not exist.Israeli minister is calling for the replacement of Palestinians in Gaza with Israelis.

In Israel with a bipartisan delegation of US Senators, Lindsey Graham goes off on a Newsmax reporter asking him to condemn Rashida Tlaib: “You’re not going to screw this up! Get this guy out of here!”. How odd for Trump to Blame America First for an act of terrorism in Israel, without a word of accountability instead for his good friend Benjamin Netanyahu, who actually runs that country.Trump, 4 days after the Hamas attack on Israel, decided to rip Netanyahu over the Soleimani strike: “I’ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing .  We were disappointed by that - very disappointed. Then Bibi tried to take credit for it.”.

Look at this pathetic NYT headline:. I met this Israeli soldier while taking a tour of the Western Wall tunnels. It turns out he turns weapons of war into meaningful art.A Palestinian Arab murders seven Jews going to synagogue in Jerusalem, the historic capital of the Jewish people.

GFY.","This has been true since Hamas took over. In 2014 there were widespread reports of reporters being threatened or expelled for reporting that al-Shifa hospital was in fact a Hamas base. Reporters then hid their own reports to retain residency in Gaza.Incredible that the Lefts response to Americans cheering to free American hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas (which denies a ceasefire), is that a Palestinian must speak in order to rip into the American ally Israel fighting to free those American hostages. Was supremely moved by this speech, which was searing and compassionate. Also seems essential to include a Palestinian speaker to the convention.   …. These pro-Hamas protests are being fostered by the faculty and patted on the head by the administration. Thats because these colleges have been completely eaten by the evil intersectional ideology that crosses streams with Jew-hatred.We ought to have sympathy for both.

If you feel no sympathy for innocent Palestinians killed in Israels revenge attacks on Gaza, you have no humanity.  Be human.The predictable results of Bidens disgusting weapons cut-off threat: 1.

In doing so, its telegraphing weakness to Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas.This creates a catch-22. If Israel does not defend itself, Israel is destroyed. If Israel does defend itself while Hamas hides behind civilians, the media blast out these images. So what, precisely, is Israel supposed to do? World opinion will not govern Jewish survival.People need to understand how the Arab and Muslim world is digesting these images.  You might say, “they’ve always been against Israel; I don’t care,” but that’s foolish.  Support can shift from being non-existent to very aggressive opposition on a broad scale in a short time.If the Israeli security cabinet approves a temporary pause in order to return some of the hostages, the world will undoubtedly take this as the first step toward cessation of hostilities. Nope. Israels mission will not and should not change: the utter destruction of Hamas.The word ""evil"" is not descriptive enough for Hamas. They murdered in cold blood six people they had taken hostage almost a year ago, including an American, just days ago -- all in an attempt to sow seeds of political chaos. A few points:  1.

Fing morons.Once again, the images from Gaza are awful and heartbreaking and entirely the fault of Hamas. The minute Hamas gives up the hostages and surrenders, this is all over. Everyone knows it. And everyone calling for a ceasefire is doing Hamas dirty work.Netanyahus democratically-elected unity government includes his chief center-left political rival, Benny Gantz. Nearly 250 IDF soldiers have been killed going door-to-door to protect civilians. Dictator Assad used chemical weapons on civilians. This comparison is asinine.Israel under Netanyahu is not really different than Syria under Assad -- a brutal government trying to protect an endangered Middle Eastern religious minority group by convincing everyone that its too savage and ruthless to mess with.  ….

VIDEO PREMIERE NOW: ""The moral thing would be to open the Gaza Strip & allow people to go to their homes & villages & the towns from where they were thrown out. But Israel doesnt want to do that. So you have millions of people sitting in a prison, so they decided to kill them. The Ceasefire Shell Game (w/ @samhusseini)  Independent journalist Sam Husseini completely dismantles the state department narrative around the ceasefire negotiations, who’s at fault, & what the new UN report tells us about Israel’s use of rape, torture, & the Hannibal.
