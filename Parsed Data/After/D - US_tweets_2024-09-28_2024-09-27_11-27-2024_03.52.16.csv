RonFilipkowski,"September 08, 2024 12:59 PM","In the last 24 hours, Trump wished the Virgin Mary Happy Birthday, pitched Hulk Hogan’s beer, talked about Hannibal Lecter, said he will imprison people he thinks are cheating, called Musk ‘Leon,” forgot Burgum’s name, called Brian ‘Briar,’ Keystone ‘Keystown,’ & Tampon ‘Tampom,’ said if he loses Israel will cease to exist, nuclear war will begin, this will be our last election, and the CO Gov will flee the state, posted an ad for his digital NFTs, ranted about Kamala standing on a box at the debate, and wrapped it up by saying schools are performing trans surgeries on students.",30764,13676,2364,1466786
