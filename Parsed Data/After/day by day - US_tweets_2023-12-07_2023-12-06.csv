mmpadellan,"October 09, 2023 04:04 PM","As a Muslim,  a father,  a brother, a son, an American, and a human being  I am APPALLED at the heinous, horrendous attacks against civilians in Israel this weekend. You dont need to fit neatly into ANY category besides ""decent human being"" to condemn the atrocities we saw carried out by Hamas.  My Dad was Jewish. My Sister is Jewish. But I dont believe you need to be Jewish, or have Jewish relatives or friends in order to speak out against antisemitism or acts of violence against Jewish people. You just need to be a decent human being.  Normally, I tend to hold my tongue in this particular issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict, mainly because I dont even know what I dont know about this issue, but I DO know killing innocent civilians is WRONG.  It hurts my heart to see the men, women, and children mourning the loss of their loved ones. I cant even imagine the pain and fear of the families of people taken hostage.  I believe Israel has the right to exist. I believe Palestine has the right to exist. I believe BOTH are attainable, but not at the cost of human lives. I believe Palestinians have legitimate concerns about the conditions they are experiencing, but I think they need more effective leadership to address them.  I believe Hamas has to be stopped.  I believe now is NOT the time to remain silent about this.",13928,2512,1894,689804
