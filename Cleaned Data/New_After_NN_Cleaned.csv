87,Republican Party,2700000,2038,-0.5,"November 21, 2023 02:25 AM","Today, @elonmusks @X sued the extremist, leftist group Media Matters in a Texas federal court for engaging in a ""plot"" to destroy its advertising. (Media Matters is notorious for trying to suppress and censor speech at odds with Leftist and Democratic Party narratives.) Ive carefully reviewed the complaint and it presents persuasive evidence of disturbing and unethical behavior by Media Matters that goes far beyond the groups typical misleading content. (After reading the complaint, I was reminded of NBC News Datelines blowing up GM pick-up trucks in order to falsely suggest the vehicles were unsafe.)   Below is the text of the complaint (minus footnotes).    COMPLAINT  1. Defendant Media Matters for America (“Media Matters”) is a self-proclaimed media watchdog that decided it would not let the truth get in the way of a story it wanted to publish about X Corp. Looking to portray X’s social networking platform as being dominated by “white nationalist and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,” Media Matters knowingly and maliciously manufactured side-by-side images depicting advertisers’ posts on X Corp.’s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white-nationalist fringe content and then portrayed these manufactured images as if they were what typical X users experience on the platform. Media Matters designed both these images and its resulting media strategy to drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp. 2. Plaintiff X Corp. operates the X social media platform with over 500 million active monthly users. X facilitates free expression and open discourse by enabling its users to create and share their own content and to message and comment on other users’ posts. These posts appear sequentially to users in “feeds,” which occasionally include paid advertisements—the overwhelming source of X Corp.’s revenue. 3. Users shape their own experiences on X. Users curate the content on their own feeds by choosing to “follow” other users, thereby determining which posts are presented to them. Most users are served a variety of content based on an algorithm that takes account of who that user follows and what that user engages with. But X also provides its users the option to forgo algorithmically suggested posts altogether, thereby enabling a user to view only the content that user chooses to view. 4. As the most prominent online platform dedicated to hosting free speech, X and its predecessor Twitter have long been the target of Media Matters. In just the last year, Media Matters has published a series of articles threatening X’s relationships with massive multinational advertisers and global publishers, including Amazon, eBay, Major League Baseball, New York Times Co., Samsung, Sports Illustrated, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Office Depot, Nokia, Dish, Bayer, Tyson Foods, Honeywell, Discovery, FanDuel, Thermo Fisher, National Women’s Soccer League, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Atlanta Falcons, Manchester City, DraftKings, FanDuel, T-Mobile, and The Athletic.1 5. This November alone Media Matters released over twenty articles (and counting) disparaging both X Corp. and Elon Musk—a blatant smear campaign. 6. For the last several years, Media Matters has falsely portrayed Twitter, now X, as a risky, unsafe platform for advertisers. Contrary to these efforts, 99% of X’s measured ad placement 7. Undeterred by the truth, Media Matters has opted for new tactics in its campaign to drive advertisers from X. Media Matters has manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X’s largest advertisers’ paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content, leaving the false impression that these pairings are anything but what they actually are: manufactured, inorganic, and extraordinarily rare. 8. Media Matters executed this plot in multiple steps, as X’s internal investigations have revealed. First, Media Matters accessed accounts that had been active for at least 30 days, bypassing X’s ad filter for new users. Media Matters then exclusively followed a small subset of users consisting entirely of accounts in one of two categories: those known to produce extreme, fringe content, and accounts owned by X’s big-name advertisers. The end result was a feed precision-designed by Media Matters for a single purpose: to produce side-by-side ad/content placements that it could screenshot in an effort to alienate advertisers. 9. But this activity still was not enough to create the pairings of advertisements and content that Media Matters aimed to produce. 10. Media Matters therefore resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing its unrepresentative, hand-selected feed, generating between 13 and 15 times more advertisements per hour than viewed by the average X user repeating this inauthentic activity until it finally received pages containing the result it wanted: controversial content next to X’s largest advertisers’ paid posts. 11. Media Matters omitted mentioning any of this in a report published on November 16, 2023 that displayed instances Media Matters “found” on X of advertisers’ paid posts featured next to Neo-Nazi and white-nationalist content. Nor did Media Matters otherwise provide any context regarding the forced, inauthentic nature and extraordinary rarity of these pairings. 12. However, relying on the specious narrative propagated by Media Matters, the advertisers targeted took these pairings to be anything but rare and inorganic, with all but one of the companies featured in the Media Matters piece withdrawing all ads from X, including Apple, Comcast, NBCUniversal, and IBM—some of X’s largest advertisers. Indeed, in pulling all advertising from X in response to this intentionally deceptive report, IBM called the pairings an “entirely unacceptable situation.”2 Only Oracle did not withdraw its ads. 13. The truth bore no resemblance to Media Matters’ narrative. In fact, IBM’s, Comcast’s, and Oracle’s paid posts appeared alongside the fringe content cited by Media Matters for only one viewer (out of more than 500 million) on all of X: Media Matters. Not a single authentic user of the X platform saw IBM’s, Comcast’s, or Oracle’s ads next to that content, which Media Matters achieved only through its manipulation of X’s algorithms as described above. And in Apple’s case, only two out of more than 500 million active users saw its ad appear alongside the fringe content cited in the article—at least one of which was Media Matters. 14. Media Matters could have produced a fair, accurate account of users’ interactions with advertisements on X via basic reporting: following real users, documenting the actual, organic production of content and advertisement pairings. Had it done so, however, it would not have produced the outcome Media Matters so desperately desired, which was to tarnish X’s reputation by associating it with racist content. So instead, Media Matters chose to maliciously misrepresent the X experience with the intention of harming X and its business.  PARTIES 15. Plaintiff X Corp. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nevada, with its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. Plaintiff conducts significant business in Texas, including maintaining significant offices in Texas. It operates the social media platform “X” (formerly “Twitter”), an internet-based service that enables users to create and share their own content, interact with other users, and curate feeds of content. 16. Defendant Media Matters is a web-based publisher incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia with its principal place of business at 800 Maine Avenue SW, Suite 400, Washington, D.C. 20024. The organization’s purpose is “to systematically monitor” conservative media and publish reports based on this purported reporting. 17. Defendant Eric Hananoki is a writer for Defendant Media Matters and is domiciled in Maryland.  JURISDICTION & VENUE 18. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because there exists complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff and Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.00. 19. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Media Matters because Media Matters’ campaign against X Corp. was purposefully directed at, among others, relationships with advertisers who are located in, have a significant presence in, or transact substantial business in Texas. Likewise, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Media Matters because its attempts to harm X Corp.’s reputation potentially threatened X Corp.’s relationships with its hundreds of millions of users, including millions of Texas users. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Hananoki for substantially the same reasons. 20. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred herein, because a substantial part of the property that is subject of the action—that is, X’s business and advertising—is situated in the district, and because all Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this District.  GENERAL ALLEGATIONS I. X is a Safe Platform for Users and Advertisers, Despite Media Matters’ Deceptions. 21. X is a social media platform that remains in operation due to its loyal users and advertisers. X Corp. invests heavily in technologies that work in tandem to facilitate safe and effective interactions between users and advertisers—technologies that, under normal, organic conditions operate seamlessly. 22. As a first layer of protection for advertisers, X applies default protections to all posts. These protections are designed to prevent advertisements from being placed next to content that violates community guidelines. When users operate within X’s community guidelines, these default mechanisms are effective and have a long history of successfully protecting X’s advertisers from undesirable interactions with fringe content. 23. As a second layer of protection, X provides advertisers with opt-in options. These options allow advertisers to further address any specific concerns they may have about their advertisements being seen next to specific content. Here, advertisers can specify which key words and user handles they do not want their posts to appear by. 24. These protections and others create a safe environment for advertisers that allow them to reach their target audiences while protecting their brands, as Media Matters well knows.  II. Media Matters Systematically Manipulated the X User Experience to Defame X. 25. On November 16, 2023, Media Matters published a false, defamatory, and misleading article with the headline, “X has been placing ads for Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, and Xfinity3 next to pro-Nazi content,” claiming that X was responsible for anti-Semitic content being paired with X’s advertisers’ paid posts.4 This statement was not true, and Media Matters knew it. As explained below and displayed in an X internal review, this title is false in that Media Matters itself—not X—was responsible for placement of the content it identified through its willful exploitation of X’s user features—a result it specifically intended to bring about. X in fact has many default safeguards that prevent the platform from displaying content in the manner artificially achieved by Defendant. 26. Further, in the body of the piece, Media Matters falsely claims that it “recently found ads for Apple, Bravo, Oracle, Xfinity, and IBM next to posts that tout Hitler and his Nazi Party on X.”5 Media Matters did not find pairings that X passively allowed on the platform. Media Matters created these pairings in secrecy, to manufacture the harmful perception that X is at best an incompetent content moderator (a harmful accusation for any social media platform), or even worse that X was somehow indifferent or even encouraging to Nazi and racist ideology. 27. On X, users can control the content on their feeds. When users show interest in particular topics, ads will generate that relate to those topics. Media Matters exploited these features by creating a secret X account precision-designed to evade normal safeguards, manipulating every aspect of the system through which posts and advertisements appear, ultimately creating the side-by-side images of objectionable content and advertisements. 28. X’s internal user data tells the story of just how far Media Matters went to manufacture an inorganic user experience strictly aimed at creating an interaction between controversial content and big-name advertisers that was seen only by the Media Matters account and then published broadly. 29. First, Media Matters set out on their attempt to evade X’s content filters for new users by specifically using an account that had been in existence for more than thirty days. 30. Next, Media Matters set its account to follow only 30 users (far less than the average number of accounts followed by a typical active user, 219), severely limiting the amount and type of content featured on its feed. All of these users were either already known for posting controversial content or were accounts for X’s advertisers. That is, 100% of the accounts Media Matters followed were either fringe accounts or were accounts for national large brands. In all, this functioned as an attempt to flood the Media Matters account with content only from national brands and fringe figures, tricking the algorithm into thinking Media Matters wanted to view both hateful content and content from large advertisers. 31. Even this did not produce Media Matters’ intended result. An internal review by X revealed that Media Matters’ account started to alter its scrolling and refreshing activities in an attempt to manipulate inorganic combinations of advertisements and content. Media Matters’ excessive scrolling and refreshing generated between 13 and 15 times more advertisements per hour than would be seen by a typical user, essentially seeking to force a situation in which a brand ad post appeared adjacent to fringe content. 32. Eventually, through intentionally evading X’s multiple safeguards by curating the content on its feed and then repeatedly attempting to create pairings of advertisements for major brands with controversial content, Media Matters finally achieved its goal. Accordingly, it took screenshots of posts from IBM, Apple, Bravo, Xfinity, and Oracle that Media Matters engineered to appear adjacent to inflammatory, fringe content.  III. To Defame X, Media Matters Hid Its Manipulation from Readers and Advertisers. 33. Media Matters generated a specific, intended result that was not only inorganic, but exceedingly (and demonstrably) rare, all while taking specific steps to obscure this in its November 16, 2023 article. The overall effect on advertisers and users was to create the false, misleading perception that these types of pairings were common, widespread, and alarming. Media Matters hid its manipulations through omissions, deceptive image selections, misrepresentations, and secrecy settings. 34. Media Matters omitted in its entirety its process of manufacturing these ad pairings. It did not include in its article that it created a user that only followed 30 accounts that either belonged to fringe figures or major national brands. Neither readers nor advertisers had any way of knowing that the entire feed was orchestrated to generate the remarkably rare combinations. Media Matters also omitted mentioning in its entirety its excessive scrolling and refreshing, allowing users to believe (falsely) that the “report” was produced under circumstances that were organic and unmanipulated. 35. Media Matters also omitted and made no attempt to clarify the rarity of these pairings. The representation put forth by Media Matters constituted 0.0000009090909 percent of impressions served on the day in question. Most or all of these pairings were not seen by literally anyone besides Media Matters’ own manipulated account, and no authentic user of the platform has been confirmed to have seen any of these pairings. 36. Media Matters’ image choice in its smear also functioned to hide the true nature of its report. All images selected contained only the ad and the controversial content, with all other posts absent from view. That is, had readers been able to see the posts above and below the pairings, they would have easily gleaned the highly-specific nature of the small number of accounts Media Matters chose to follow. Media Matters chose to show every pairing in its article using this deceptive technique—hiding its deceit through even more deceit. 37. Tellingly, Media Matters used X’s privacy features in order to hide its methodology from its readers. That is, Media Matters set this account to “private,” blocking anyone from seeing which accounts Media Matters actually followed, thus disallowing anyone from understanding how its feed was manipulated. Indeed, Media Matters at no point includes images with any information about the account that was exposed to these images; the cropped nature of Media Matters’ deceptive screenshots leaves its profile picture out of frame. 38. Accordingly, Media Matters created the impression that these pairings were organic, accurate, and representative of the typical X user’s experience, which actually and demonstrably misled users and advertisers, causing harm to X Corp.  V. Media Matters Caused Advertisers to Believe the Pairings Were Organic. 39. After the publication of Media Matters’ false smear on November 16, 2023, advertisers pulled their ads from the site, which, as Media Matters admits, only happened after it reported that X was placing ads alongside white nationalist and pro-Nazi content. Included in these companies, which all referenced antisemitic content in their withdrawal from X, are:  Comcast. After Media Matters’ November article featured a contrived, misleading, and inflammatory image showing an ad for Xfinity next to a pro-Nazi post, its parent company Comcast decided to pull all ads for Comcast entities from X.  NBCUniversal. As the parent company of Bravo and a subsidiary of Comcast, NBCUniversal pulled all advertising from X after publication of the article.  Apple. The day after publication of the article, which also featured an Apple ad contrived to be placed next to fringe content, Apple—one of X’s largest clients—pulled all of its ads from the platform.  IBM. As previously discussed, IBM pulled all ads immediately after the publication of the article.  40. Media Matters’ manipulation was so severe that companies not even featured in the article also pulled ads from X. These companies include Lionsgate, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, and Sony.  VII. Media Matters Intended to Harm X’s Revenue Stream. 41. Media Matters represents itself as “a progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.”6 Since its launch in 2004, it has engaged in an all-out campaign of “guerilla warfare and sabotage” on conservative news sources.7 In this context, X Corp. and Elon Musk are a critical Media Matters target because X is the most prominent online platform that permits users to share all viewpoints, whether liberal or conservative, and Mr. Musk is the most prominent voice on the platform and a passionate supporter of free speech. In taking down two forces it already found objectionable, Media Matters had the chance to starve X of ad revenue and thereby silence all of the voices on X. Nothing in Media Matters’ campaign was coincidental or accidental. And, its guerilla attack on X is working, driving away X’s advertisers and revenue precisely as intended.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Interference With Contract 42. X Corp. re-alleges and incorporates by reference the above allegations. 43. At all relevant times, Defendants were aware that Plaintiff contracted with various third parties, including but not limited to Apple, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Bravo, Apple, and IBM, to sell ads on the X platform, as clearly demonstrated by the many articles written by Defendants on the topic. 44. Defendant Media Matters intentionally interfered with contracts between X Corp. and its advertisers, including but not limited to Apple, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Bravo, Apple, and IBM—all clients with existing advertisement agreements that were casualties of Defendant’s misrepresentations and ceased advertising on the X platform as a direct result.  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION Business Disparagement 45. X Corp. re-alleges and incorporates by reference the above allegations. 46. Defendant Media Matters made statements that disparaged the quality of X Corp.’s product, X. 47. Defendant Media Matters made these statements as statements of fact, not opinion. Defendant Media Matters represented that X “has been placing” advertisements next to anti- Semitic and racist materials. It represented that it “found” these materials next to advertisements. 48. As extensively explained above, these statements made by Defendant Media Matters were false. 49. Defendant Media Matters intentionally made these statements with clear malice, well aware of their falsity. 50. X Corp. suffered monetary loss as a result of these statements: companies mentioned in Defendant’s false and misleading article pulled their advertising from X indefinitely.  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage 51. X Corp. re-alleges and incorporates by reference the above allegations. 52. X Corp. was engaged in economic relationships that would have resulted in an economic benefit to X Corp. X Corp. had relationships with advertisers that pulled their spending in light of Defendant Media Matters’ article and had every reason to suspect that these relationships would continue. 53. At all relevant times, Defendant Media Matters knew of these relationships, as they were described in its “reporting.” 54. Defendant Media Matters engaged in wrongful conduct that disrupted X Corp.’s economic relationships. Through extensive deception and misrepresentation, Defendant Media Matters caused advertisers to lose faith in X Corp.’s abilities to monitor and curate content, thereby leading them to break off these lucrative relationships and any future continued relationships. 55. Defendant Media Matters acted with the intent to disrupt these relationships. Media Matters’ actions continued its expressly declared “guerilla war” on media it dislikes and its systematic, harassing attacks on X Corp. and Elon Musk. 56. X Corp. was harmed as a result of Defendant Media Matters’ actions: it lost advertisers as a result of Defendant’s interference. 57. Defendant Media Matters’ actions were undoubtedly a substantial factor in causing this harm, with Defendant’s website even noting that X Corp.’s relationships fell apart after Media Matters released its maliciously false piece.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff X Corp. prays for judgment in its favor and the following relief:  1. Actual and consequential damages caused by Defendants’ misconduct, including but not limited to all general and special damages; 2. A preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Defendants to immediately delete, take down, or otherwise remove the article entitled “As Musk Endorses Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory, X Has Been Placing Ads for Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, and Xfinity Next to Pro-Nazi Content From Its Web” from all websites and social media accounts owned, controlled, or operated, directly or indirectly, by Defendants; 3. X Corp.’s costs and attorneys’ fees to litigate this action; and 4. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.",1919,706,46,82256
87,Republican Party,2700000,4395,-0.5,"October 26, 2023 09:12 PM","October 24, 2023  VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION The Honorable Merrick Garland Attorney General Department of Justice The Honorable Christopher Wray Director Federal Bureau of Investigation  Dear Attorney General Garland and Director Wray:  Since July 25, 2022, I have requested information from  the Justice Department and FBI with respect to legally protected whistleblower disclosures  that informed my office of political bias infecting the decision-making process in investigations related to the Biden family. 1 Since that date, the Justice Department and FBI have failed to provide responsive records. This letter is based on years of investigation, including the provision of information, records, and allegations from multiple Justice Department whistleblowers that indicate there is - and has been - an effort among certain Justice Department and FBI officials to improperly delay and stop full and complete investigative activity into the Biden family, including but not limited to FD-1023s referencing the Biden family. This alleged political infection breaks faith with the American people, and it will ruin our governmental institutions should it continue. As just one initial example, Ive been made aware that at one point in time the FBI maintained over 40 Confidential Human Sources that provided criminal information relating to Joe Biden, James Biden, and Hunter Biden. An essential question that must be answered is this: did the FBI investigate the information or shut it down? Indeed, if those sources were improperly shut down, it wouldnt be out of the ordinary for the FBI, as this letter will address.  By way of initial background, since August 2019, Senator Johnson and I have investigated the Biden familys foreign financial dealings and business arrangements. On September 23, 2020, and November 18, 2020, we issued reports detailing our findings based in part on hundreds of Treasury Department Suspicious Activity Reports, transcribed interviews, and thousands of pages of Obama/Biden administration government records. Our findings indicated potential criminal activity, to include money laundering, with respect to members of the Biden family and their business associates as well as strong financial connections to questionable foreign nationals and foreign government-linked corporate entities. Then, in March and April of 2022, we gave three speeches on the Senate Floor and made public bank records supporting the same findings and further connecting the Biden family business to businesses linked to the communist Chinese government. After that, on October 26, 2022, Senator Johnson and I provided hundreds of pages of bank records to U.S. Attorney Weiss connecting the Biden family to Chinese-government linked entities. Since August 2019, the Justice Department and FBI have refused to answer our questions, cooperate with our investigation, and have made every effort to obstruct and frustrate legitimate and constitutional congressional oversight.  On July 25, 2022, I wrote to the both of you.5 In that letter, I described whistleblower allegations that the FBI developed information in 2020 about Hunter Biden s criminal financial and related activity but ultimately shut it down based on false assertions that it was subject to foreign disinformation. Its been alleged that the basis for shutting the investigative activity down was an August 2020 assessment created by FBI Supervisory Intelligence Analyst Brian Auten. That assessment was used by an FBI HQ team to improperly discredit negative Hunter Biden information as disinformation and caused investigative activity to cease. The precise basis for how the FBI HQ team selected the specific information for inclusion in Autens assessment is unknown, but the focus of the FBI HQ teams attention involved derogatory information about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.  In that same letter, I noted that in October 2020, an avenue of derogatory Hunter Biden reporting was ordered closed at the direction of Assistant Special Agent in Charge Tim Thibault. My office has been made aware that FBI agents responsible for the information that was shut down were interviewed by the FBI HQ team in furtherance of Autens assessment. Publicly released portions ofThibaults interview with the House Judiciary Committee confirm the whistleblower allegations. The transcript reportedly notes that an FBI HQ and FBI Baltimore element wanted the Hunter Biden reporting closed, which Thibault followed through on.  On October 13, 2022, I wrote to the both of you and U.S. Attorney Weiss with respect to specific records within the possession of the Justice Department and FBI indicating potential criminal activity in the Biden familys foreign business deals. This included the Biden family 1023 that Chairman Comer and I ultimately made public on July 25, 2023. Specifically, I requested an array of records relating to that Biden family 1023. While all three recipients of my letter have failed to provide the requested information, none have disputed the allegations Ive presented to them.  Although investigative activity was scuttled by the FBI in 2020, the origins of additional activity relate back to years earlier. For example, in December 2019, the FBI Washington Field Office closed a ""205B"" Kleptocracy case, 205B-~ Serial 7, into Mykola Zlochevsky, owner of Burisma, which was opened in January 2016 by a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FBI squad based out of the FBIs Washington Field Office. This Foreign Corrupt Practices Act squad included agents from FBI HQ. In February 2020, a meeting took place at the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office with FBI HQ elements. That meeting involved discussion about investigative matters relating to the Hunter Biden investigation and related inquiries, which most likely wouldve included the case against Zlochevsky. Then, in March 2020 and at the request of the Justice Department, a ""Guardian"" Assessment was opened out of the Pittsburgh Field Office to analyze information provided by Rudy Giuliani.  During the course of that assessment, Justice Department and FBI officials located an FD-1023 from March 1, 2017, relating to the ""205B"" Kleptocracy investigation of Zlochevsky. That FD-1023 included a reference to Hunter Biden being on the board of Burisma, which the handling agent deemed at the time non-relevant information to the ongoing criminal financial case. And when that FD-1023 was discovered, Justice Department and FBI officials asked the handler for the Confidential Human Source (CHS) to re-interview that CHS. According to reports, there was ""a fight for a month"" to get the handler to re-interview the CHS. Eventually, that re-interview took place and the Biden family 1023 about the alleged criminal scheme between then-Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, and Zlochevsky was created in June 2020. A 1023 must be serialized to a case, so that Biden family 1023 was serialized to the Pittsburgh Assessment. Accordingly, claims that the Biden family 1023 was part of the information provided by Giuliani are incorrect. The information in the Biden family 1023 was obtained separate from Giuliani from a long-standing, high-paid FBI CHS whos been used in other investigative matters by the FBI, as the Zlochevsky case illustrates. That Biden family 1023 was serialized into the Pittsburgh Assessment simply because it was the administrative avenue to house the source information.  Due to the fact there was no case and merely an assessment, Justice Department and FBI officials were limited in their investigative abilities including conducting database checks instead of using subpoenas and search warrants. In addition, my office has been informed that the FBI agents and DOJ officials working the Pittsburgh Assessment had to pause their work for weeks at a time because the assessment had to be reapproved every 30 days by multiple DOJ and FBI officials. On June 30, 2020, the Biden family 1023 was serialized into the Pittsburgh Assessment, and FBI leadership would likely have been briefed on it due to the nature of the reporting. Either on that day or shortly thereafter, travel mentioned in the Biden family 1023 was confirmed as well as some meetings that took place.  In August 2020, and possibly earlier, Supervisory Intelligence Analyst Brian Auten opened the aforementioned assessment, which was used by the Foreign Influence Task Force to seek out CHS holdings at FBI Field Offices across the country relating to the Biden family and falsely discredit them as foreign disinformation. Also, in August 2020, the Foreign Influence Task Force improperly briefed me and Senator Johnson with respect to our Biden family investigation after pressure from congressional Democrats. That improper briefing was used by Democrats and the partisan media to falsely claim our investigation, which was based on Obama/Biden administration records, was impacted by foreign disinformation.   On September 3, 2020, the Pittsburgh Assessment was closed - after a mere six months- and on September 14, 2020, the Foreign Influence Task Force communicated with the handling agent for the Biden family 1023. According to information provided to my office, the Foreign Influence Task Force attempted to shut down that reporting by falsely saying it was subject to foreign disinformation. It should be emphasized that the basis for trying to shut down the Biden family 1023 has been described to my office as highly suspect and is contradicted by other documents my office has been told exist within the Foreign Influence Task Force, FBI Seattle Field Office, FBI Baltimore Field Office, and FBI HQ holdings.  On September 21, 2020, after closure of the Pittsburgh Assessment, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady transmitted a report to Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Rich Donoghue summarizing the findings of the FBI assessment. The subject line of that report stated, ""VETTING."" According to information provided to my office, the officials involved in the assessment had limited ability to verify all information in the Biden family 1023 because the Justice Department did not authorize them to use a grand jury and, therefore, they didnt have all the tools at their disposal to run the information to ground, including subpoenas to obtain documents and interviews. However, the report included a recommendation that additional investigative activity be done. Notably, my office has been informed that, with respect to the CHS in the Biden family 1023, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania coordinated with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York in 2020 and found no hits to known sources of Russian disinformation. The report, including information on the Biden family 1023, was ultimately transmitted to U.S. Attorney Weiss who, according to Attorney General Garland, had every investigative tool at his disposal even before being designated as a special counsel.   Since making the Biden family 1023 public on July 25, 2023, its been made clear by former Attorney General Barr, Director Wray, and Deputy Director Abbate that the 1023 is part of an ongoing investigative matter, indicating its investigative credibility and authenticity. As such, its essential that we examine the alleged attempts by FBI personnel to sweep it under the rug, as well as what steps U.S. Attorney Weiss has taken to use the document for his ongoing investigation.  On October 5, 2020, Supervisory Special Agent Eric Miller and Assistant Special Agent in Charge Thibault participated in a call with the Washington Field Office; Baltimore Field Office; Wilmington, Delaware FBI agents; and FBI management personnel. That call allegedly included Assistant Special Agent in Charge Alfred Watson, Supervisory Special Agent Joe Gordon, Special Agent Susan Roepcke and Special Agent Joshua Wilson. Notably, FBI agents from the Baltimore Field Office were attached to U.S. Attorney Weisss investigation. My office has been informed that on that call it was confirmed the Delaware case currently run by U.S. Attorney Weiss was opened as a money laundering and Foreign Agents Registration Act case, not a bribery case as the Biden family 1023 would appear to require, and that it was jointly worked with the IRS. On that call, it was made clear that Delaware FBI agents were in possession of email evidence that contradicted denials made by Joe Biden that he was never aware of or involved in Hunter Bidens business arrangements.  On October 23, 2020, Tony Bobulinski met with and was interviewed by James Dawson, a Washington Field Office Special Agent in Charge, Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge Giulio Arseni, Special Agent William Novak, and Special Agent Garrett Churchill. Bobulinski provided first-hand knowledge as an eye and ear witness to Joe Bidens involvement in potentially criminal schemes with Hunter Biden. Notably, on October 13, 2022, I wrote a letter to the both of you and U.S. Attorney Weiss with respect to a summary of Bobulinskis FBI interview that my staff reviewed which included, in part, reference to the Bidens receiving an unsecured $5 million loan, intended to be forgivable, from CEFC in 2017 that would serve as payment for actions Joe Biden took during his vice presidency. This financial strategy to illegally treat income as a loan is consistent with IRS whistleblower testimony that indicated Hunter Biden attempted the same with respect to other income, including payments received from Burisma.  Also on October 23, 2020, Justice Department and FBI Special Agents from the Pittsburgh Field Office briefed Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesley Wolf, one of U.S. Attorney Weisss top prosecutors, and FBI Special Agents from the Baltimore Field Office with respect to the contents of the Biden family 1023. However, the meeting did not include any IRS agents, and AUSA Wolf prevented investigators from seeking information about Joe Biden s involvement in Hunter Bidens criminal arrangements.  Based on the information provided to my office over a period of years by multiple credible whistleblowers, there appears to be an effort within the Justice Department and FBI to shut down investigative activity relating to the Biden family. Such decisions point to significant political bias infecting the decision-making of not only the Attorney General and FBI Director, but also line agents and prosecutors. Our Republic cannot survive such a political infection and you have an obligation to this country to clear the air.

79,Republican Party,4400000,9652,-0.5,"April 15, 2024 12:23 PM","BREAKING!!  I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the lunacy of Biden’s Iran policy.  Biden’s position in refusing to support Israel from taking offensive military action against Iran means that BIDEN WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY MILITARY STRIKES AGAINST IRAN’S NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND THAT IRAN WILL HAVE A FUNCTIONING NUCLEAR ARSENAL WITH WHICH TO THREATEN THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, THE ARAB WORLD, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WITHOUT FEAR OF MILITARY ATTACK. The best time for Israel to hit Iran’s nuclear sites, with critical U.S. support, would’ve been now.  Biden’s appeasement of Iran and intentional funding of Iran, lack of deterrence against Iran and efforts at crippling Israel’s efforts to neutralize Iran’s military and terrorist operations, ensures that Islamist-fundamentalist Iran will become a nuclear power. And once that occurs there will be few options to limit Iran’s ambitions short of a devastating confrontation with frightening risks. What will we do if Iran closes the Red Sea and other navigable waters used to transport oil? And It will also contribute even further to the firepower of the China-Russia-NK-Iran axis and cause other Middle East countries to acquire nuclear weapons. THIS is the world Biden and Blinken are creating while sanctimoniously lecturing about their efforts to de-escalate military confrontations.  Again, the crucial point is that Biden has not only signaled to Iran that no effective action will be taken to stop its nuclear program but Biden has actually acted to ensure that Iran’s final path to building nuclear weapons is open and clear. That’s what is meant by no support for offensive military action against Iran.  The idea that missile defenses are the answer to preventing offensive strikes against Israel or any country is lunacy. On its face it’s illogical. It’s a deterrent under certain circumstances. Maybe in many circumstances. But ultimately you don’t stop missile attacks by chasing another country’s. You stop missile attacks with certainty by destroying that country’s capacity for launching missiles and/or deterring such attacks by subjecting that country to punishing offensive military attacks. Despite Biden’s massive and current propaganda operation to the contrary, facts are facts.  Furthermore, it’s beyond debate that the duplicitous Biden actually colluded with Iran through intermediaries to create the events that took place in the skies over Israel a few nights ago. And, of course, Israel was in the dark about it. (This is the same Biden regime that outrageously demands tactical approval over Israel’s battlefield decisions.) Why? Because it wouldn’t have gone along with such treachery and put its people through such a heinous subterfuge. Think about how morally corrupt, among other things, the Biden regimes actions truly are.  Biden and the Iranian regime sympathizer, Blinken, coordinated with Iran over the timing, types of missiles, and even Iranian propaganda. The purpose was to prevent Israel from pulverizing Iran’s military capabilities. Indeed, the Biden regime began leaking immediately to their favorite reporters and media outlets (many of the same press sympathizes they relied on during the Obama regime to promote the Iran nuclear deal) that Israel had provoked Iran and hadn’t told the U.S. in advance about the planned attack on Iran’s terrorist compound in Damascus. Obviously, Israel didn’t forewarn Blinken because he would’ve leaked it to the media! Moreover, Israel is not obliged to get permission from Biden on how and whether to defend its people. Biden and Blinken are hostile to Israel and seek to overthrow its democratic government. They’ve repeatedly told this openly to the entire world, including the Iranians.  Every one of these shocking and appalling Biden regime mobster tactics, and there are more, with the attendant scheming, plotting, leaking, usurping, and back-stabbing against a longtime essential and loyal ally, which is in a daunting and bloody war literally triggered by the insane policies of the Biden regime, is beneath contempt and a stain on America’s character and reputation as the world’s moral beacon.  It is Biden and Blinken who are impulsive, ignorant, reckless, incompetent, and dangerous. It is they who’ve abandoned a rational and prudent foreign policy in pursuit of incoherent and ideologically-driven utopian ambitions. And it is they who’ve escalated military conflict on multiple continents. For them, there is no good or evil, right or wrong. Hence, they fund Iran and threaten Israel. They seek Netanyahu’s ouster and the ayatollah’s approval.  Be worried. Very worried.",7947,2830,932,358206

I know that if we get this election wrong, that there won’t be a blue state she can go to for an abortion, not even one which would save her life.

In fact, fentanyl is coming across the border in such large amounts the FBI director said theyve seized enough to kill 270 MILLION people.  Meanwhile, Biden regime has turned aggressively against Israel, it does not want Israel to win the war, and is leaking incessantly against Israel to their favorite media outlets, including the radical leftwing Politico.  It says it is concerned Israel is killing terrorists in populated areas (where Hamas terrorists operate, for crying out loud.) Check this out from the stenographers for Biden at Politico:  U.S. officials have asked the Israeli military to explain its airstrike on a densely populated refugee camp in Gaza this week, after the attack killed dozens of people, according to U.S. and Israeli officials. The Biden administration requested Israel detail the thinking and process behind the recent strike on the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Northern Gaza, according to a U.S. official, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. Administration officials urged Israel to conduct “precision targeting” in order to avoid harming civilians, the official said. “The U.S. asked for an explanation of the first attack on Jabalia,” said the official, adding that the conversation was in the context of “asking Israel to do more to avoid civilian casualties.” From the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. has asked questions of Israel about their goals and how to achieve them, and urged them to avoid harming civilians, the official stressed. However, U.S. “support for Israel’s right to defend itself remains solid.” Pentagon officials have asked the Israel Defense Forces specifically about the Israeli bombardment of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza on Tuesday, an Israeli official said, adding that Israel “puts a lot of effort into ensuring civilians are out of harm’s way.” A House Democrat familiar with U.S.-Israeli conversations said the administration “has been pushing very hard in private on the Israelis to ease back” — particularly after the bombing of the refugee camp.The House member added Democrats are preliminarily discussing measures to penalize Israel should it not change course, such as “actual enforcement of existing human rights vetting.” “There are mechanisms in place to achieve what we need to achieve,” the lawmaker said, like the Leahy Law that prohibits assistance to countries committing human rights abuses. “Whenever we provide military assistance to partners including Israel … we do make clear that that support must be used consistent with international law, to include the Law of War, and obligations related to protecting civilians,” Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters Thursday. One senior DOD official went a step further, saying that in private conversations, Pentagon officials have been asking the IDF to “think through their operations” and take into account the lives of innocent civilians.",1748,499,282,151344

It wont work as they hang on the words ""were"" and ""werent."" The media have been horrendous in their coverage of the Oct. 7 slaughter of Israeli Jews and their subsequent use of Hamas lies, including the notorious reporting about the Gaza hospital, which they blamed on Israel, the use of Hamas statistics, the regurgitation of Biden administration talking points, and relentless insinuations and worse about Israel and its military killing civilians.  The New York Times and Washington Post essentially covered up the Holocaust as it was occurring.

In 1983, the United States Marine barracks in Beirut was blown up by Muslim males. 8. In 1985, the cruise ship Achille Lauro was hijacked, and a 70-year-old American passenger was murdered and thrown overboard in his wheelchair by Muslim males. 9.

These are the words of Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for decades.  As you watch the death and destruction that is currently unfolding in Israel and Palestine, its important for you to know that the Israeli government is responsible for the rise of Hamas.  If it wasnt for Israels government, Hamas might not even exist at all.  Starting in the late 1970s, the Israeli government decided that they wanted a radical Islamist ""counterweight"" to the PLO, which was run by Yasser Arafats secularist and left-wing Fatah party.   Their thinking was that, if the Palestinians were busy fighting each other, they wouldnt be able to fight Israel. Divide and conquer.  Starting in the late 1970s, they began giving direct funding to a fringe group of radicals, their organizations, and their mosques.  One of them was Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza, who had also formed the Islamist group Mujama al-Islamiya. They were recognized as a charity by the Israeli government in 1979, and started receiving funding soon after.  Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor in Gaza at the time, said that he was given a budget to fund these mosques and organizations, and was told to give them preferential treatment over the PLO.  Cohen wrote an official report to his superiors in the 1980s, where he warned them against continuing this strategy. “I suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,” he wrote at the time.  They didnt listen.  In 1987, those groups formed Hamas, and the rest is history.  Thousands of innocent Israelis and Palestinians killed.  And as we see today, that death count continues to rise.  Its important to note that the US government gives billions of dollars to the Israeli government, and hundreds of millions to the Palestinian authority.  American taxpayers are being forced to bankroll the carnage youre currently witnessing.  Its long past time for that to end.  Foreign military aid is the act of taking money from working Americans, and giving it to rich, powerful foreigners, to fund wars, genocides, terrorism and other horrors.

Is it because he demeaned a POW, attacked a Gold Star family and told a military widow that her deceased husband “knew what he had signed up for.” Was it the time he downplayed the traumatic head injuries suffered by our troops after a missile attack as “not real” because they weren’t ‘missing hands and limbs.’ Is it due to all the years he tried to slash benefits for our veterans, the time he said he didn’t want to be seen with war-wounded amputees, and to keep them forever out of his sight, or the time he called our fallen heroes of war “suckers” and “losers”? Is it the all the times he called our military leaders “dumb” and “overrated” while calling terrorists like the Taliban & Hezbollah “very smart”? Was it the time he demanded the flags after McCain’s death be returned to full mast, or the time he demanded that a ship bearing his name be blocked from view? Was it when he stole, hid and lied about our national security secrets, potentially imperiling countless men & women in uniform all over the world? Or was it when he suggested that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff deserved to be executed? Maybe it was when he asked Gen. John Kelly (who lost his son in combat) at Arlington National Cemetery, why anyone would sign up for service because as far as he saw it, there was “nothing in it for them.” Perhaps it was hearing him say that as President he would allow our adversary to attack the same allies this county’s Greatest Generation fought beside and died defending?
