He told her that as she grows into a young lady she’s going to fill out very nicely & said hes excited to see her growth over time. I was enraged. I dont want her going to this school anymore & I want to report this teacher. My husband said the comment shouldn’t be taken too seriously because it was just a “joke”. He said a report like this could ruin the teachers whole life. My husband said not to ruin the guys life because our daughter is already going to be leaving the school. He also thinks this guy could target our family if he finds out that he was reported & it could turn into a potentially dangerous situation.I ABSOLUTELY think the comment should be taken seriously regardless. Would I be an AH to go against my husbands wishes & just report it even though she will no longer be attending that school?

I was in drama…one of them was my good friend.It took so long because they just passed the law extending the statute of limitations indefinitely. She didn’t sue at the time because she didn’t have the courage (or the resources) to fight them when they told her to shut up about it the first time through. She does now. She’s going to take that whole family down. The teacher in question is still teaching there btw. I think they have finally banned the husband.,

One of them later went on to marry the teacher. Zero were reported; I think 1 got fired because they were involved with like 3 different kids.

If the daughter is ever (god forbid) harassed or assaulted in the future and she remembers the incident with the teacher she might not report it since the dad is overblowing the situation by saying the teacher might target the family and the whole thing “could turn into a potentially dangerous situation” which in this particular case seems unlikely  (of course every case is different and safety is paramount)4.  If the dad convinces her that what her teacher said wasn’t that bad (it was) and if/when she gets into a situation like this in the future she might not have developed that thing all women should possess in their gut—that thing you should listen to that tells you to walk away5.  Abuser language like “it was just a joke” and just the way this has caused so much anger in the dad—when that gets normalized it is a bad bad thingI’m sure I’m forgetting something. OP I hope if that is what the teacher really said you stand your ground because what happens right now will have implications for your daughter for years to come.,

That evidence comes from pissed off parents. We had a PE teacher that said/did creepy stuff all the time but between his friends protecting him and kids not reporting it took YEARS to get enough to rid ourselves of him.

Apparently this had just happened and she was visibly upset about the whole thing. I asked her some questions about it and apparently the guy told the girls he was “just looking for the female teacher” and wandered around for a bit before leaving. I guess some of the girls who weren’t dressed were trying to hid behind their lockers and he told them not to make such a big deal out of it. I immediately sent her to the office to report the incident and followed up with it with the administrators. There is no guy code or teacher code that would hold me back from reporting the guy. He’s clearly a creep. Fuck him.

Previous behavior aside I’m not jumping to conclusions by calling him a creep and I don’t need to hear his side of the story. Men are very well aware that we have absolutely no reason to enter a female locker room. The janitors stand at the doorway and yell to make sure no girls are in there before they go in to clean and that’s when they know no girls are in there.

Because of the paper trail it was so easy for him to be fired despite having tenure and having been at the school for at least 15 years. Also his kids went there. After the school year ended though we never saw those kids again. I remember hearing years later that he was never able to teach again because that followed him. OP PLEASE report this.

Staying quiet keeping the peace leads to kids not knowing how/when to advocate for themselves because it will upset others.

We had a female gym teacher who would do naked shower inspections everybody knew about it but school NEVER did anything — was originally middle schoolers & then highschoolers so impacted thousands of girls Yes sometimes touching was involved. Another PE teacher kept reporting her. Administration said if she didn’t stop reporting she’d get fired.PS. During Covid some conversations - not specifically around her but other teacher pedos came up in an alum Fb group. then it just went viral turned out over 30 years at least 30 (but more likely closer to 60 based on private Survivor group) teachers were involved. Most impacted multiple different kids multiple different times. Everything from unsuccessful grooming to violent attacks - one on a classmate of mine another on a friend’s little sister.School never took any real accountability & their so-called investigation was really camouflage discovery to protect them legally.Your challenge though will be doing something about it without documentation. Particularly if you don’t have your spouse’s support & your child doesn’t understand what happened. Or can’t recount it in a way that that school cannot pick apart.,

Report the teacher. Then inform the police that the teacher showed pedophile behavior ks6c6y3 ks7wbgd ks80oix] and put him on their radar.

Narcissistic abusers often get caught because there’s a paper-trail. If he’s never done anything like this before and if it legitimately is a misunderstanding then they won’t fire him for the weird gross comment. If this guy has a record of creeping out kids and parents the complaint will be much more consequential. Even if your daughter won’t ever see him again after this school year you’ll be helping protect the kids in future classes.,

The more people let these perverts get away with the more theyll do. So your daughters leaving soon what about the next girl he targets? What will he do to her or the ones after? It shouldnt have to progress for it to be stomped out. I work in a school theres safe guarding for major outside and inside incidents and theres safe guarding for minor inside incidents.

When I was 19 multiple family friends were over. Their kids varied in ages but there were two 13 year olds. They asked for a hug and I gave them a hug. And then they kept asking for it and I heard them discuss that they wanted to feel boobs. They thought they were being so discrete. I was so uncomfortable. They chased me around the backyard trying to hug me. I told my bf at the time and he was like “they’re just teens. It’s harmless. Let them” and some other stuff. And I felt so bad. Like maybe I overreacted. I was so embarrassed that I didn’t tell my parents. And I really should have. I feel safe around my parents and can talk to them about anything. But ex put it in my mind that I was overreacted probably and was going to the friendship my parents have with their parents. \nThose boys turned into shitty men. I’ll never forgive my ex for this. Just because those boys were younger doesn’t mean they didn’t realize what they were doing is fucked up. Anyway some men support other men. Even if they’ve never met them don’t know anything about them and aren’t even friends. People like my ex and OP’s husband are shitty men and the reason why predators get away with things. They will always support other men over SA.,

I had him in first grade and again later in fourth. I really didn’t like him but at that age I couldn’t articulate why. I just thought he was too friendly. But now as an adult I know why. I had very long hair down to my butt. He would always play in my hair or touch my shoulders. And he’d say I was very pretty. I was a really shy and anxious kid so I just couldn’t say anything. But even without the anxiety I was just a kid who didn’t know any better. My point is I remember that. I’m 22 years old and I remember this teacher being a creep to me from the fourth grade. You never know what your kid will carry throughout their life. This could be one of those things.,
